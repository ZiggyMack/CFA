## BROKEN LINKS BY SEVERITY

### CRITICAL (0 links)
No links to deleted FOR_OMEGA_NOVA/ or identity/ directories found in docs/

## LINK VALIDATION RESULTS

### Links Pointing to DELETED v4.0 Files
✅ No references to deleted FOR_OMEGA_NOVA/ directory found
✅ No references to deleted /identity/ directory found (properly migrated to /docs/i_am/)
✅ FILE_INVENTORY.md correctly documents deletions as "handoff complete"

### Links to NEW v5.0 Files (Nyquist Integration)
✅ All 43 Nyquist-Sync files properly referenced within subdirectory
✅ ZIGGY_LITE.md and ZIGGY_FULL.md in auditors/Bootstrap/Kernels/ (new location)
✅ I_AM_ZIGGY.md in docs/i_am/ (new location)
✅ S7_5_SPECTRAL_IDENTITY_DECOMPOSITION.md properly located
✅ Identity Lattice Maps reference structure correct

### Links to REORGANIZED Bootstrap Files
⚠️ 2 outdated references to old bootstrap file names:
   - BOOTSTRAP_GROK.md → should reference auditors/Bootstrap/Grok/GROK_LITE.md
   - BOOTSTRAP_NOVA.md → should reference auditors/Bootstrap/Nova/NOVA_LITE.md
✅ All persona directories exist: Claude/, Grok/, Nova/, Guests/
✅ Each persona directory contains LITE bootstrap files

### Cross-Directory References
✅ docs/ → auditors/ references all verify correctly
✅ docs/architecture/ → docs/i_am/ references all verify correctly
✅ docs/ → docs/manuals/ references all verify correctly
✅ docs/repository/ → ../ references all verify correctly

==========================================================================
## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Fix Broken Links (2 files)
Update in docs/architecture/CFA/CFA_ARCHITECTURE.md:
- Line 415: Change [auditors/Bootstrap/BOOTSTRAP_GROK.md] to [auditors/Bootstrap/Grok/GROK_LITE.md]
- Line 441: Change [auditors/Bootstrap/BOOTSTRAP_NOVA.md] to [auditors/Bootstrap/Nova/NOVA_LITE.md]

### Priority 2: Verify Bootstrap File References
Search all docs for references to:
- BOOTSTRAP_GROK.md (72 total references found)
- BOOTSTRAP_NOVA.md (confirm count)
- BOOTSTRAP_CLAUDE.md (confirm count)

Determine if these are:
a) Template examples (intentionally non-resolvable) - leave as-is
b) Actual broken links - update to new locations
c) Historical documentation - may need archival

### Priority 3: Ensure Version Clarity
✅ v5.0.0 reorganization properly documented in FILE_INVENTORY.md
✅ Migration from old structure to new persona-specific bootstrap system clear
✅ Nyquist integration additions well-documented

==========================================================================
