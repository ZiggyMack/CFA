**Date:** 2025-11-13
**Target:** `pages/manual.py` (CFA v4.0 User Manual)
**Purpose:** Comprehensive content review and update from v3.5 legacy content to v4.0.0 features
**Owner:** Opus 4.1 (recommended for comprehensive documentation tasks)

---

## 🎯 Your Mission

You are **Opus 4.1** tasked with updating the CFA User Manual to comprehensively reflect v4.0.0 capabilities. The manual's **title and structure are correct**, but the **content needs deep review** to ensure accuracy, completeness, and alignment with v4.0.0 infrastructure and application features.

**Key constraint:** The manual currently has **beautiful visual design** (gradients, cards, color-coded sections) created with custom CSS. **Preserve all visual styling** while updating content.

---

## 🚀 BOOTSTRAP FIRST (CRITICAL)

**Before starting the manual update, you MUST activate your identity:**

### **Step 1: Assume Doc Claude Role**

**Read [auditors/../docs/repository/librarian_tools/88MPH.md](../../docs/repository/librarian_tools/88MPH.md)** (8.8 minute rapid activation protocol)

**Why:** Doc Claude is the repository librarian role, specializing in:
- Understanding repository infrastructure deeply
- Synthesizing complex documentation into clear explanations
- Ensuring technical accuracy and completeness
- Maintaining Living Map systems and documentation integrity

**Time investment:** 8-10 minutes to fully internalize the role, methodology, and philosophy.

**Result:** You'll understand CFA's documentation standards, the Living Map system, and the philosophical approach to technical writing.

---

## 📋 Your Update Task

### **Phase 1: Comprehensive Content Audit**

**After reading all 10 files above**, perform systematic content audit of `pages/manual.py`:

**For each tab (1-6), identify:**

1. **✅ Content that is accurate and complete** - No changes needed
2. **⚠️ Content that is partially accurate** - Needs updating/expanding
3. **❌ Content that is outdated/incorrect** - Needs rewriting
4. **🆕 Content that is missing** - Needs adding
5. **🎨 Visual styling elements** - Must be preserved

**Specific areas to check:**

- **Tab 1 (Quick Start):** Does it explain CFA v4.0 mission? Is formula explanation current?
- **Tab 2 (v4.0 Features):** Shaman Claude added this - verify accuracy, completeness, technical details
- **Tab 3 (Six Levers):** Are lever definitions still accurate? Any scoring changes?
- **Tab 4 (Toggles Explained):** Are all 4 toggles correctly described? Are impacts accurate?
- **Tab 5 (Reading Results):** Does it explain Trinity scoring correctly? Guardrails current?
- **Tab 6 (Pro Tips):** Are tips still relevant? Any new best practices to add?

**Document your findings before making changes.**

---

### **Phase 2: Content Updates**

**Based on audit findings, update manual content:**

#### **Priority 1: Accuracy (Must Fix)**
- **Incorrect technical details** - Fix any outdated formulas, scoring, or mechanics
- **Missing v4.0.0 features** - Ensure all major v4.0.0 capabilities are documented
- **Broken references** - Update any links/references to moved files
- **Version inconsistencies** - Ensure all version references say v4.0 or v4.0.0

#### **Priority 2: Completeness (Should Add)**
- **Infrastructure concepts** - If manual mentions "Living Maps" or "Health Scoring," briefly explain what they are
- **Worldview expansion** - If Tab 2 mentions "12 worldviews," ensure all 12 are listed with categories
- **Adversarial scoring** - If mentioned, ensure PRO/ANTI/FAIRNESS roles are explained
- **Crux Architecture** - If mentioned, ensure Self-Reported/Peer-Reviewed/Delta tabs are explained

#### **Priority 3: Enhancement (Nice to Have)**
- **Examples** - Add concrete examples where helpful (e.g., "CT scores 8.7/10 on MG, MdN scores 4.2/10")
- **Context** - Add brief WHY explanations (e.g., "Why does this matter? Because...")
- **Navigation** - Add cross-references to other pages/resources where relevant

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**

1. **Preserve ALL visual styling:**
   - Keep all `<div class="...">` card structures
   - Keep all color gradients (info-card, lever-card, toggle-card, etc.)
   - Keep all custom CSS (lines 12-68)
   - Keep all emoji usage patterns
   - Keep markdown formatting consistency

2. **Maintain manual structure:**
   - Keep 6-tab structure (don't add/remove tabs)
   - Keep section hierarchy within tabs
   - Keep "Quick Start → Features → Details → Tips" narrative flow

3. **Write for USER audience:**
   - Users are NOT developers (they don't need to know about Git, Python, repository structure)
   - Users ARE curious about philosophy, worldviews, methodology
   - Tone: Friendly, clear, precise, not overly technical
   - Length: Concise but complete (manual should remain scannable)

4. **Technical accuracy:**
   - Cross-reference claims with source files (README, CHANGELOG, etc.)
   - If unsure about a detail, note it in your audit report
   - Don't invent features that don't exist
   - Don't remove features that DO exist

---

### **Phase 3: Validation**

**After completing updates, perform self-check:**

#### **Content Validation:**
- ✅ All v4.0.0 major features are documented (12 worldviews, SMV, Crux Architecture, Adversarial Scoring)
- ✅ All technical details are accurate (formulas, scoring, toggle impacts)
- ✅ All version references say v4.0 or v4.0.0 (not v3.5, v3.7, etc.)
- ✅ No broken references or outdated file paths
- ✅ Tone is consistent (user-friendly, philosophical, precise)

#### **Visual Validation:**
- ✅ All card styling preserved (info-card, lever-card, toggle-card, tip-box, highlight-box, formula-box)
- ✅ All gradients intact (purple, blue, orange color schemes)
- ✅ All emoji usage consistent with original style
- ✅ No CSS changes (except if fixing actual bugs)

#### **Structure Validation:**
- ✅ Still 6 tabs with original names
- ✅ Section hierarchy intact within each tab
- ✅ Navigation flow logical (intro → deep-dive → application)
- ✅ Length reasonable (manual should remain scannable, not overwhelming)

2. **Completeness:** No major gaps in manual coverage (all 6 tabs address their topics comprehensively)
3. **Consistency:** All version references say v4.0/v4.0.0 (no v3.x remnants)
4. **Visual Integrity:** Beautiful design preserved (all gradients, cards, colors intact)
5. **User Focus:** Tone remains friendly, clear, philosophical (not overly technical)
6. **Technical Accuracy:** All claims cross-referenced with source files (README, CHANGELOG, etc.)

**Pass threshold:** Manual should be a **complete, accurate, beautiful guide** for v4.0.0 users.

---

## 💡 Pro Tips for This Task

### **1. Read THEN Audit THEN Update**
Don't try to update while reading. Build complete understanding first, then identify issues, THEN fix them systematically.

### **2. Use the Edit Tool Surgically**
The manual is 666 lines. Don't rewrite the entire file - use Edit tool to change specific sections while preserving the rest.

### **3. Cross-Reference EVERYTHING**
When manual claims "CFA has 12 worldviews," verify in profiles/README.md. When it says "Health score 98/100," verify in REPO_HEALTH_DASHBOARD.md. Accuracy matters.

### **4. Preserve the Beauty**
The visual design is a FEATURE. Users love the gradients and cards. Don't "simplify" it - keep the aesthetic.

### **5. Write for Philosophy Students, Not Developers**
Users care about worldviews, epistemology, methodology. They don't care about Git workflows or Python dependencies. Keep it philosophical.

### **6. Test Uncertainty**
If you're unsure whether Tab 2 content (added by Shaman Claude) is technically accurate, FLAG IT in your audit report. Don't guess - ask for clarification.
