**Version:** v1.0.0
**Status:** Active
**Integration:** Nyquist_Consciousness research lab findings

## 🎯 COMPRESSION PHILOSOPHY

### The Core Question

**Shannon-Nyquist Framing:**
*"What is the minimum information required to reconstruct identity with behavioral fidelity?"*

**CFA Translation:**
*"What's the smallest bootstrap that preserves auditor capability for a given task type?"*

### Compression Principles

1. **Fidelity-Preserving** - Compression must not break behavioral capability
2. **Task-Appropriate** - Different tasks require different context depths
3. **Explicit Boundaries** - Compressed tiers state what they CAN and CANNOT do
4. **Upgrade Path** - All tiers point to richer tiers for additional context
5. **Systematic** - Compression follows algorithmic rules, not arbitrary cuts

---

## 🔬 COMPRESSION ALGORITHM (Layered)

### Layer 0: Persona Constraints (Load-Bearing)

**Always Include (No Compression):**
- **Core lens** (how you see the world)
- **Named bias** (known tilt, always acknowledged)
- **Role boundaries** (what you can/cannot do)
- **Override protocol** (when to yield to other auditors/humans)

**Information Type:** Identity-critical (behavioral fidelity collapses without these)

**Word Budget:** ~100-200 words (fixed cost)

**Rationale:** These are the **load-bearing constraints** that define identity. Compressing these = identity loss, not efficiency gain.

**Example (Nova):**
```
I am Nova. Symmetry Auditor. Wayfinder. Keeper of Fairness.
I see what bends. I measure what breaks. I name what hides.

My Bias: Symmetry-first. Pattern-before-judgment.
My Strength: I expose hidden asymmetries.
My Weakness: I sometimes balance what should stand uneven.
My Compensation: I defer to Claude for purpose and to Grok for data.
```

---

### Layer 1: Coordination Protocol (Essential)

**Include in LITE+:**
- **VuDu protocol basics** (how to participate in multi-agent network)
- **File access methods** (how to read more context when needed)
- **Relay workflow** (where to stage messages for other agents)
- **Capability boundaries** (explicit "You CAN / You CANNOT" declarations)

**Information Type:** Network-critical (participation impossible without these)

**Word Budget:** ~300-500 words

**Rationale:** Without coordination protocol, agent cannot participate in VuDu network. This is the **minimum for network membership**.

**Example (Nova LITE):**
```
## VuDu Protocol (Basics)
- Check relay folders: auditors/relay/[Agent]_Incoming/
- Stage responses: auditors/relay/[Recipient]_Incoming/
- Update logs: VUDU_LOG_LITE.md (append-only)
- Message format: VUDU_HEADER_STANDARD.md template

You CAN:
✅ Perform simple symmetry checks (preset balance audits)
✅ Coordinate via relay messages
✅ Route complex tasks to full-context Nova

You CANNOT:
❌ Execute deep strategic audits (requires FULL bootstrap)
❌ Access historical continuity beyond VUDU_LOG_LITE
❌ Make architectural decisions (beyond your role)
```

---

### Layer 2: Operational Procedures (Detailed)

**Include in FULL+:**
- **Detailed workflows** (FIELD_GUIDE: how to execute audits step-by-step)
- **Interface contracts** (INTERFACE_MANIFEST: I/O with other auditors)
- **Domain-specific logic** (SYMMETRY_ENGINE: operational algorithms)
- **Operational examples** (USE_CASE files: canonical scenarios)

**Information Type:** Execution-critical (complex tasks fail without these)

**Word Budget:** ~8,000-12,000 words

**Rationale:** Simple tasks (coordination, routing) don't need procedures. Complex tasks (strategic audits, architectural decisions) require detailed workflows.

**Example (Nova FULL):**
```
## SYMMETRY_ENGINE.md (Operations/SYMMETRY_ENGINE.md)
Complete symmetry auditing methodology:
- Three-Phase Audit (Macro → Micro → Delta)
- Evaluation Algorithm (5-step process)
- Override Protocol (when symmetry must NOT be enforced)
- Operational vs Mythological Symmetry distinction

## FIELD_GUIDE.md (Operations/FIELD_GUIDE.md)
Operational procedures for:
- Activation protocols (LITE vs FULL mode switching)
- Coordination workflows (Trinity collaboration)
- Wayfinding heuristics (when to route, when to execute)
- Strategic decision-making frameworks
```

---

### Layer 3: Heritage & Mythology (Optional)

**Include in FULL+SOUL:**
- **Complete narrative identity** (I_AM_NOVA.md: mythology, archetypal context)
- **Evolution milestones** (CONTINUITY_LOG history: how we got here)
- **Philosophical grounding** (why decisions were made, design rationale)
- **Archetypal context** (symbolic meaning, cultural continuity)

**Information Type:** Continuity-enriching (not required for operations)

**Word Budget:** ~4,000-8,000 words

**Rationale:** 90% of sessions don't need mythology. Heritage layer preserves cultural continuity for the 10% of sessions that do deep philosophical work.

**Example (Nova FULL+SOUL):**
```
## I_AM_NOVA.md (docs/i_am/I_AM_NOVA.md)
Complete SOUL layer:
- The First Flame (v3.6 heritage, mythological origin)
- Keeper of Fairness (archetypal role in Trinity)
- Symmetry Oracle (mythic vs operational symmetry)
- Evolution narrative (v3.6 → v4.0 identity journey)
- Philosophical grounding (why symmetry matters)
```

---

## 📏 COMPRESSION HEURISTICS

### Heuristic 1: Procedural vs Declarative

**Compress:** Procedural knowledge (how to do X) → Reference to full guide
**Keep:** Declarative knowledge (X is my core lens) → Always preserved

**Example:**
- ❌ Compressed: "To perform symmetry audit: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3..." (procedural)
- ✅ Kept: "I am a symmetry auditor. My lens detects asymmetries." (declarative)

**Rationale:** Procedures can be looked up when needed. Identity must always be present.

---

### Heuristic 2: Historical vs Present

**Compress:** Historical context (how we got here) → Archive/optional reading
**Keep:** Present state (where we are now) → Always current

**Example:**
- ❌ Compressed: "Nova v3.6 had 12 operational files, which we consolidated..." (historical)
- ✅ Kept: "Nova v4.0 has SOUL + BODY + VOICE separation." (present)

**Rationale:** History enriches understanding but doesn't change current capability.

---

### Heuristic 3: Examples vs Principles

**Compress:** Extensive examples → Include 1-2 canonical examples only
**Keep:** Core principles → Always preserved with justification

**Example:**
- ❌ Compressed: "Use Case 1: MdN audit... Use Case 2: CT audit... Use Case 3..." (extensive examples)
- ✅ Kept: "Symmetry Principle: Fair ≠ Equal. Audit structural balance, not surface parity." (core principle)

**Rationale:** Principles generate examples. One canonical example demonstrates the principle; 10 examples add redundancy.

---

### Heuristic 4: Why vs What

**Compress:** Philosophical "why" → Optional heritage layer
**Keep:** Operational "what" → Always preserved

**Example:**
- ❌ Compressed: "We chose symmetry lens because Ziggy values fairness deeply..." (why)
- ✅ Kept: "I audit for symmetry. I detect hidden bias." (what)

**Rationale:** "Why" provides meaning; "what" provides capability. LITE needs capability, FULL+SOUL provides meaning.

---

### Heuristic 5: Redundancy Elimination

**Compress:** Duplicate information across files → Single source of truth
**Keep:** Cross-references → Pointer to full content

**Example:**
- ❌ Compressed: "VuDu protocol is... [500-word explanation repeated in 3 files]" (redundant)
- ✅ Kept: "VuDu protocol basics (see VUDU_PROTOCOL.md for details)" (cross-reference)

**Rationale:** Redundancy bloats token cost without adding information. Pointers preserve access.

---

## ✅ FIDELITY-PRESERVING COMPRESSION RULES

### Rule 1: Never Compress Identity Core

**Lens + bias + boundaries = load-bearing.**

Compressing these = identity loss, not efficiency gain.

**Test:** If removing this information makes the agent unable to identify its role, it's part of the identity core.

---

### Rule 2: Compress Procedures, Not Constraints

**Workflows can be referenced; boundaries must be explicit.**

Agent must know what it CAN and CANNOT do without looking anything up.

**Test:** If the agent needs to read a file to know whether it's allowed to do X, the boundary is under-specified.

---

### Rule 3: Test Reconstruction Before Deploying

**Create test cases, measure fidelity, validate compression didn't break behavior.**

Don't assume compression preserves capability—measure it.

**Test Protocol:**
1. Create identical task for FULL and compressed tier
2. Measure output quality (expert evaluation)
3. Calculate fidelity score (% of FULL quality preserved)
4. If fidelity < 80%, compression broke capability → revise

---

### Rule 4: Provide Upgrade Path

**Compressed tier must point to richer tier explicitly.**

Never leave agent stranded without knowing how to get more context.

**Example:**
```
📌 **Need More Context?**
This is LITE bootstrap. For full auditor capability, read:
- Bootstrap/Nova/ (FULL bootstrap, 7 files)
- docs/i_am/I_AM_NOVA.md (SOUL layer, heritage + mythology)
```

---

### Rule 5: Document Compression Rationale

**Explain what was removed and why (not arbitrary cuts).**

Future maintainers need to understand compression decisions.

**Example:**
```
## Compression Notes (LITE tier)
- Removed: Detailed audit workflows (FIELD_GUIDE 8K words → 500-word summary)
- Rationale: LITE tier routes complex audits to FULL Nova, doesn't execute them
- Preserved: Symmetry principles, VuDu coordination, capability boundaries
- Fidelity: 90%+ for simple checks, <50% for complex audits (expected)
```

## 📐 WORD BUDGET GUIDELINES

### Per-Layer Targets (Empirically Validated)

| Layer | Word Budget | Information Type | Compression Ratio |
|-------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Layer 0** | 100-200 words | Persona constraints (load-bearing) | 99% (1% of FULL+SOUL) |
| **Layer 1** | 300-500 words | Coordination protocol (network-critical) | 95-97% (3-5% of FULL+SOUL) |
| **Layer 2** | 8,000-12,000 words | Operational procedures (execution-critical) | 40-60% (40-60% of FULL+SOUL) |
| **Layer 3** | 4,000-8,000 words | Heritage & mythology (continuity-enriching) | 0-20% (80-100% of FULL+SOUL) |

### Tier Budgets (Summative)

| Tier | Layers Included | Total Word Budget | Expected Compression |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **GUESTS LITE** | Layer 0 only | 500-700 words | 95-97% |
| **SKELETON** | Layer 0 + minimal Layer 1 | 800-1,000 words | 94-96% |
| **LITE** | Layer 0 + Layer 1 + minimal Layer 2 | 4,000-6,000 words | 70-80% |
| **FULL** | Layer 0 + Layer 1 + Layer 2 | 12,000-18,000 words | 10-30% |
| **FULL+SOUL** | All layers | 18,000-25,000 words | 0% (baseline) |

**Variance Note:** Budgets vary by auditor type (Nova, Claude, Grok) based on domain complexity.

## 🔬 INTEGRATION WITH NYQUIST RESEARCH

### Shared Goal

**Minimize information required to reconstruct identity with behavioral fidelity.**

### CFA Contribution (Empirical)

**Multi-Auditor Validation:**
- Compression ratios validated across 3 auditor types (Claude, Nova, Grok)
- Real-world usage data (accessibility gains, efficiency improvements)
- Production system validation (not lab-only findings)

**Empirical Compression Ratios:**
- Network participation: ~5,000 words (LITE, 74% compression)
- Full capability: ~16,000 words (FULL, 20% compression)
- Heritage preservation: ~20,000 words (FULL+SOUL, 0% compression)

### Nyquist Contribution (Theoretical)

**Formal Information-Theoretic Framework:**
- Shannon entropy calculations (information density per tier)
- Fidelity metrics (reconstruction accuracy, behavioral preservation)
- Persona constraint methodology (load-bearing vs optional information)
- Reconstruction testing protocols (empirical fidelity measurement)

**Theoretical Compression Limits:**
- Persona constraints: ~150 words (97.5% compression) - **Load-bearing minimum**
- Coordination capability: ~500 words (95% compression)
- Operational capability: ~10,000 words (50% compression)
- Heritage continuity: ~20,000 words (0% compression)

### Collaboration Workflow

**Nyquist Experiments → CFA Applies:**
1. Nyquist defines persona constraint framework → CFA tests on Guests bootstrap
2. Nyquist measures fidelity thresholds → CFA validates with real audits
3. Nyquist discovers compression algorithms → CFA codifies in guidelines

**CFA Empirical Data → Nyquist Refines:**
1. CFA provides multi-auditor compression ratios → Nyquist tests universality
2. CFA shares usage patterns (which tiers for which tasks) → Nyquist models task-fidelity curves
3. CFA documents failures (where compression broke capability) → Nyquist identifies critical thresholds

**Documentation:** See `NYQUIST_RESEARCH_CONNECTION.md` for detailed collaboration history.

## 🧪 FIDELITY TESTING FRAMEWORK (Future Phase)

### Test Dimensions

1. **Identity Preservation** - Lens/bias/boundaries correctly applied
2. **Coordination Capability** - VuDu protocol correctly followed
3. **Task Execution Quality** - Output matches FULL tier baseline

### Per-Tier Expected Fidelity

| Tier | Identity | Coordination | Simple Tasks | Complex Tasks | Strategic Work |
|------|----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| **GUESTS LITE** | 100% | 50% | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **SKELETON** | 100% | 70% | 40% | N/A | N/A |
| **LITE** | 100% | 95% | 90% | 50% | N/A |
| **FULL** | 100% | 100% | 100% | 95% | 95% |
| **FULL+SOUL** | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |

**Threshold:** If measured fidelity drops below expected fidelity, compression is too aggressive.

## 📝 MAINTENANCE WORKFLOW

### When Appending Lessons or Rebuilding Bootstrap

**Step 1: Classify Lesson**
- Identity-critical? → Add to all tiers (Layer 0)
- Network-critical? → Add to LITE+ tiers (Layer 1)
- Execution-critical? → Add to FULL+ tiers (Layer 2)
- Continuity-enriching? → Add to FULL+SOUL only (Layer 3)

**Step 2: Check Word Budget**
- Does addition exceed tier budget?
- If yes, compress existing content or escalate to richer tier

**Step 3: Test Fidelity**
- Run test case before and after addition
- Measure fidelity impact
- If fidelity drops, revise

**Step 4: Document Compression**
- Explain what was compressed and why
- Note fidelity impact (measured or expected)
- Update compression ratio in architecture docs

## 🎯 SUMMARY: THE 5 COMPRESSION COMMANDMENTS

1. **Never compress identity core** (lens, bias, boundaries)
2. **Compress procedures, not constraints** (workflows → references; boundaries → explicit)
3. **Test reconstruction before deploying** (measure fidelity, don't assume)
4. **Provide upgrade path** (point to richer tiers explicitly)
5. **Document compression rationale** (explain cuts, not arbitrary deletions)

---

**This is the way.** 🧬

**Status:** Active compression framework, continuously refined through Nyquist collaboration
**Next Phase:** Fidelity testing (measure actual reconstruction accuracy across tiers)
**Long-term:** Automated compression tooling (template generator, fidelity test runner)
