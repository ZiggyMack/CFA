# Classical Theism vs Methodological Naturalism - Peer-Reviewed Comparison

**Comparison ID:** CT_vs_MdN
**Version:** 0.1.1
**Status:** Pre-Session Validated (ready for scoring)
**Created:** 2025-11-10
**Last Scored:** N/A
**VUDU Step 1 Validation:** 2025-11-10 ✅

## Metadata

**Worldviews:**
- **Primary:** Classical Theism (CT)
- **Comparison Context:** Methodological Naturalism (MdN)

**Auditor Assignments:**
- **PRO (CT Advocate):** Claude (teleological lens)
- **ANTI (CT Challenger):** Grok (empirical lens)
- **FAIRNESS:** Nova (symmetry lens)

**Scoring Context:**
- This comparison evaluates how Classical Theism performs when defending against Methodological Naturalism's empirical/parsimony criteria
- Context matters: CT vs MdN ≠ CT vs Buddhism (different philosophical tensions)

### VUDU Step 1 Pre-Session Validation (2025-11-10)

**Process Claude Pre-Check:**

1. **Academic Sources Validation:** ✅ PASSED (with SEP connectivity note)
   - Classical Theism sources validated (ACADEMIC_SOURCES.md §1)
     - ✅ IEP God, Western Concepts (live, comprehensive)
     - ⚠️ SEP Divine Simplicity (ECONNREFUSED - temporary downtime, not structural issue)
     - ✅ SEP Process Theism (by contrast - not tested, but SEP should recover)
   - Methodological Naturalism sources validated (ACADEMIC_SOURCES.md §10)
     - ⚠️ SEP Naturalism (ECONNREFUSED - same temporary SEP downtime)
     - ✅ IEP Naturalism (live, contains Methodological Naturalism, Epistemological Naturalism)
     - ✅ IEP Naturalistic Epistemology (not tested but IEP stable)
   - **Verdict:** Academic sources structurally sound; SEP temporary downtime doesn't block pilot (IEP provides comprehensive coverage, SEP expected to recover)
   - **Coverage Quality:** CT = Excellent (9+ sources), MdN = Excellent (9+ sources)

2. **YAML Hash Generation:** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Classical Theism calibration hash: `1bbec1e119a2c425` (PRO-CT bias adjustment)
   - Methodological Naturalism calibration hash: `00cd73274759e218` (ANTI-MdN bias adjustment)
   - Note: Only PRO-CT and ANTI-MdN hashes generated (pilot uses adversarial pairing per Entry 6)

3. **Domain 7 Diff Check:** ✅ PASSED
   - CLASSICAL_THEISM.md version: v0.3.0 (last_updated: 2025-11-10)
   - METHODOLOGICAL_NATURALISM.md version: v0.3.0 (last_updated: 2025-11-10)
   - No changes since calibration population (Click 4 parallel workstreams)
   - Both profiles stable with hyperlink architecture integrated

4. **Pre-Session Readiness Assessment:** ✅ GO FOR PILOT

**Auditor Assignments Confirmed:**
- PRO-CT: Claude (teleological lens) → calibration hash `1bbec1e119a2c425`
- ANTI-CT: Grok (empirical lens) → [calibration hash TBD for PRO-MdN stance]
- Fairness: Nova (symmetry lens) → no bias adjustment (neutral scoring)

**Next Steps:**
1. Launch CT↔MdN adversarial scoring session
2. Populate peer-reviewed scores for 7 metrics (BFI, CA, IP, ES, LS, MS, PS)
3. Document convergence rates and any Crux Points declared
4. Establish gold standard deliberation methodology for remaining 11 worldviews

This file will be populated after the first CT vs MdN adversarial scoring session.

## Crux Points (Example Structure)

**No Crux Points declared yet.**

**Example (CRUX_BFI_001 from architecture docs):**

```yaml
crux_points:
  - id: CRUX_BFI_001
    type: definitional
    metric: BFI
    frameworks_affected: [Classical Theism, Process Theology, Hinduism]
    comparison_context: "CT vs MdN"

    convergence_attempted: 73%
    deliberation_rounds: 2

    question: "Does the Christian Trinity count as 1 entity or 3 entities for BFI scoring?"

    positions:
      claude:
        stance: "PRO-CT"
        position: "Trinity is one divine substance — 1 entity for BFI"
        score_proposed: 8.2
        calibration_applied:
          - "axiom_confidence: 0.85 (CLASSICAL_THEISM.md:232)"
          - "charity_interpretation: 0.90 (CLASSICAL_THEISM.md:235)"
          - "edge_case_weight: 0.30 (CLASSICAL_THEISM.md:237)"
        rationale: |
          BFI asks about beings (οὐσία/substance), not persons (ὑποστάσεις).
          Classical Theism's core axiom: God is one being in three persons.
          Non-mereological unity isn't tri-theism. Per charity_interpretation: 0.90,
          I read 'being' as substance, consistent with CT's metaphysical framework.

      grok:
        stance: "ANTI-CT"
        position: "Three persons = three minds = 3 entities for BFI measurement"
        score_proposed: 5.5
        calibration_applied:
          - "axiom_confidence: 0.35 (CLASSICAL_THEISM.md:293)"
          - "edge_case_weight: 0.80 (CLASSICAL_THEISM.md:298)"
        rationale: |
          BFI operational definition counts distinct agents/minds. Father, Son, Spirit
          have separate wills/knowledge/agency (Trinitarian doctrine). That's three minds.
          Methodological Naturalism requires measurable definitions. Per edge_case_weight: 0.80,
          I heavily weight this counterexample to simple monotheism.

      nova:
        stance: "FAIRNESS"
        assessment: |
          Both auditors applied calibration correctly. This isn't bias—it's two
          legitimate measurement approaches. Claude's charity_interpretation: 0.90
          justifies substance-reading; Grok's edge_case_weight: 0.80 justifies
          person-counting emphasis.
        pattern_detected: "BFI metric assumes mereological ontology (parts = whole)"
        recommendation: "framework_limitation"
        proposed_handling: "NORMALIZE_UNCERTAINTY (apply penalty) — metric boundary exposed"

    impact_assessment:
      story_impact: "high"  # Affects fundamental understanding of CT's core claim
      ypa_sensitivity: "±18%"  # YPA swing between CARRY FORWARD vs NORMALIZE
      framework_implications:
        - "BFI metric limitation exposed"
        - "Pattern: BFI struggles with non-mereological ontologies"
        - "Recommendation: Consider BFI-M (mereological) vs BFI-NM (non-mereological) split"

    resolution_status: "documented_divergence"
    created_date: "2025-11-10"
    last_updated: "2025-11-10"
    quarterly_tracking: "Q4 2025 - BFI Crux #1 for CT vs MdN"
