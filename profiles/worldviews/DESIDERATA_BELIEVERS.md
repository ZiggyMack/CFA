## Philosophical Foundations

### Declared Axiom

Desiderata Believers begin with the axiom that belief adoption should be guided by pragmatic considerations - what promotes human flourishing, psychological well-being, meaning, and social cohesion - rather than purely epistemic warrant. If belief in God, afterlife, objective morality, or cosmic meaning enhances life quality, these beliefs are justified even if evidential support is ambiguous or insufficient by strict epistemic standards.

### Philosophical Framework

Desiderata Believers operate within pragmatist epistemology and therapeutic philosophy, drawing from William James' "The Will to Believe," Pascal's Wager, and contemporary positive psychology. The position prioritizes practical consequences of belief over theoretical truth, arguing that some domains (religion, morality, meaning) permit or require belief adoption based on desirability rather than evidence.

Core commitments include: pragmatic theory of justification (beliefs justified by beneficial consequences), voluntarism about belief (we can and should choose beneficial beliefs in underdetermined domains), and therapeutic value of religious/metaphysical beliefs. Desiderata Believers reject both strict evidentialism (believe only what evidence warrants) and fideism (belief without any rational basis), instead arguing for rational acceptance of desirable beliefs when evidence is ambiguous.

### Key Principles

1. **Pragmatic Justification:** In domains where evidence underdetermines belief (God, afterlife, meaning), pragmatic considerations (psychological benefit, social cohesion, moral motivation) justify belief adoption.

2. **Therapeutic Value of Belief:** Religious and metaphysical beliefs that promote flourishing, reduce existential anxiety, and provide meaning are rationally acceptable even if not evidentially proven.

3. **Voluntarism:** Humans have some control over belief adoption in underdetermined domains. Choosing beliefs that enhance well-being is rational and permissible when strict evidence is unavailable.
