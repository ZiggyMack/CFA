## Philosophical Foundations

### Declared Axiom

Process Theology, rooted in Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy, begins with the axiom that reality is fundamentally processive rather than substantial. God is dipolar: the primordial nature (eternal, conceptual) envisions all possibilities, while the consequent nature (temporal, physical) experiences and is affected by the world. God persuades creation toward value but does not coerce - divine power is persuasive, not controlling.

### Philosophical Framework

Process Theology rejects classical theism's immutability, impassibility, and timelessness in favor of a God who is genuinely temporal, responsive, and affected by creation. Drawing from Whitehead, Hartshorne, and Cobb, the tradition emphasizes panentheism (God includes but transcends the world), divine temporality, and libertarian freedom for all actual entities. God's power is limited by creaturely freedom - God cannot unilaterally prevent evil but works persuasively within constraints.

### Key Principles

1. **Dipolar Theism:** God has both primordial nature (eternal, unchanging, envisioning all possibilities) and consequent nature (temporal, changing, experiencing the world). God is both eternal and temporal.

2. **Persuasive Power:** God influences creation through persuasion (lure toward optimal possibilities) rather than coercion. Creaturely freedom limits divine power; God cannot unilaterally prevent evil.

3. **Panentheism:** The world exists within God (panentheism, not pantheism). God is affected by and responsive to creaturely experiences, making divine love genuinely relational.
