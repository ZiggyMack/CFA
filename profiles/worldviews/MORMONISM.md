## Philosophical Foundations

### Declared Axiom

Mormonism (LDS) begins with the axiom that God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit are three distinct glorified beings united in purpose. Joseph Smith received divine revelations restoring the fullness of the gospel, including the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price. Continuing revelation through living prophets guides the Church, and humans have potential for eternal progression toward godhood.

### Philosophical Framework

Mormonism operates within a framework of restored Christianity emphasizing material theism (God has a perfected physical body), eternal progression (humans are eternal beings progressing toward exaltation), and continuing revelation (canon is open, living prophets receive divine guidance). The tradition rejects ex nihilo creation and traditional trinitarian theology in favor of social trinitarianism and material metaphysics.

Core commitments include: God as exalted man ("As man is, God once was; as God is, man may become"), pre-mortal existence of spirits, earth life as probationary state, temple ordinances as necessary for exaltation, and eternal families sealed through priesthood authority. These shape LDS approaches to epistemology (revelation through prophets and personal testimony), ethics (obedience to commandments and temple covenants), teleology (eternal progression toward godhood), and anthropology (humans as literal spirit children of God with divine potential).

### Key Principles

1. **Continuing Revelation:** God speaks through living prophets today, expanding and clarifying truth. Canon is open, and personal revelation confirms prophetic teachings through the Holy Ghost.

2. **Eternal Progression:** Humans are eternal beings (intelligence → spirit → mortal → resurrected) with potential for exaltation to godhood through faithful obedience, temple ordinances, and Christ's atonement.

3. **Material Theism:** God the Father has a perfected, glorified physical body. Spirit and matter are both eternal; creation is organization of pre-existing elements, not ex nihilo creation.
