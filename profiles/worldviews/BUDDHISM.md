## Philosophical Foundations

### Declared Axiom

Buddhism begins with the Four Noble Truths revealed by the Buddha: (1) Dukkha - suffering/unsatisfactoriness is universal, (2) Samudaya - suffering arises from tanha (craving/attachment), (3) Nirodha - suffering can cease through elimination of craving, (4) Magga - the Eightfold Path leads to liberation (nirvana).

### Philosophical Framework

Buddhism operates within a non-theistic, pragmatic soteriological framework emphasizing direct experiential insight over metaphysical speculation. Core doctrines include anatta (no-self), anicca (impermanence), dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda), and karma-rebirth. Buddhism rejects substance ontology, eternal souls, and creator gods in favor of process metaphysics and phenomenological analysis.

### Key Principles

1. **Four Noble Truths:** Suffering is universal; craving causes suffering; suffering can end; the Eightfold Path leads to cessation.

2. **Three Marks of Existence:** All phenomena are dukkha (unsatisfactory), anicca (impermanent), anatta (non-self/lacking inherent existence).

3. **Middle Way:** Avoid extremes of hedonism and asceticism; cultivate ethical conduct, meditation, and wisdom for liberation.
