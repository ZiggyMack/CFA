## Philosophical Foundations

### Declared Axiom

Orthodox Judaism begins with the axiom that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob entered into covenant with Israel and revealed the Torah (both written and oral) at Mount Sinai. This revelation includes the 613 commandments (mitzvot) and the interpretive tradition preserved in the Talmud and rabbinic literature. Halakha (Jewish law) is binding, authoritative, and central to covenantal faithfulness.

### Philosophical Framework

Orthodox Judaism operates within the framework of covenantal monotheism, emphasizing divine election of Israel, ongoing relationship with HaShem (the Name), and faithful observance of Torah. The tradition includes diverse streams (Modern Orthodox, Haredi, Hasidic) but shares core commitments to Sinaitic revelation, halakhic authority, and Jewish peoplehood.

Core commitments include: Torah min HaShamayim (Torah from Heaven), the binding nature of both written and oral Torah, the authority of rabbinic interpretation, and the centrality of mitzvot observance. These shape Orthodox Jewish approaches to epistemology (revelation through Torah and tradition), ethics (commanded actions rooted in divine will), teleology (covenantal life aimed at tikkun olam and messianic redemption), and anthropology (humans created in divine image with obligation to sanctify life through mitzvot).

### Key Principles

1. **Torah min HaShamayim:** Torah is divine revelation given at Sinai - both written (Tanakh) and oral (Mishnah, Talmud, rabbinic codes). This grounds the authority of halakha and the interpretive tradition.

2. **Halakhic Authority:** Jewish law (halakha) derived from Torah and developed through rabbinic interpretation is binding on Jewish life. Observance of mitzvot is central to covenantal faithfulness.

3. **Covenantal Peoplehood:** Jews are bound to God through covenant (brit) and to each other as am yisrael (the people of Israel). Jewish identity is both religious and peoplehood-based, with obligations to community and continuity.
