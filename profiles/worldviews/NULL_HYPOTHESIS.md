## Philosophical Foundations

### Declared Axiom

The Null Hypothesis position begins with the axiom that the default epistemic stance toward any claim is suspension of judgment (epoché) until sufficient evidence warrants belief. Neither belief nor disbelief is the default - rather, withholding assent pending adequate justification. This applies to metaphysical claims (God, soul, afterlife), moral claims (objective values), and claims about meaning/purpose.

### Philosophical Framework

The Null Hypothesis operates within skeptical epistemology, drawing from Pyrrhonian skepticism, Humean empiricism, and contemporary epistemology's burden-of-proof frameworks. It is methodologically agnostic - not claiming knowledge that claims are false (strong atheism, moral anti-realism), but rather suspending judgment on claims lacking sufficient warrant.

Core commitments include: proportioning belief to evidence, burden of proof on positive claimants, and epistemic humility in the face of uncertainty. The Null Hypothesis rejects both dogmatic belief and dogmatic disbelief in favor of principled suspension of judgment. It is compatible with provisional acceptance of well-evidenced claims while remaining open to revision.

### Key Principles

1. **Suspension of Judgment:** Default epistemic position is neither belief nor disbelief but epoché (withholding assent). Belief requires positive warrant; absence of warrant mandates suspension, not contrary belief.

2. **Proportioning Belief to Evidence:** Credence should track available evidence. Strong claims require strong evidence; extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Certainty is rarely warranted.

3. **Burden of Proof:** Those making positive existence/value claims bear the burden of proof. Skepticism toward unsupported claims is methodologically appropriate, not a substantive metaphysical position.

## Lifecycle Hooks

_[All 6 Trinity hooks implemented with Null Hypothesis-specific guidance - Bootstrap, Audit, Incident, Release, Deliberation, Comparative Audit]_
