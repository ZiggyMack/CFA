## Philosophical Foundations

### Declared Axiom

Error Theory begins with the axiom that moral discourse is systematically in error. When people make moral claims ("lying is wrong", "charity is good"), they purport to state objective facts about moral properties, but these properties do not exist in reality. Therefore, all positive moral claims are false - not meaningless (as non-cognitivists claim), but factually mistaken.

### Philosophical Framework

Error Theory operates within metaethical anti-realism, most notably associated with J.L. Mackie's "Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong" (1977). The position combines cognitivism (moral statements express beliefs that can be true or false) with nihilism (all positive moral beliefs are false because moral facts don't exist). Error theorists typically provide "error theories" explaining why humans systematically make these false moral claims (evolutionary psychology, social projection, etc.).

Core commitments include: moral anti-realism (no objective moral facts exist), cognitivism (moral statements are truth-apt), and systematic error (people believe moral facts exist but are mistaken). Error Theory rejects both moral realism (objectivism) and non-cognitivism (expressivism, emotivism). Instead, it maintains that moral language functions as if reporting facts, but the supposed facts don't obtain.

### Key Principles

1. **Moral Anti-Realism:** No objective moral properties, facts, or truths exist in reality. The universe is normatively inert - facts about what IS do not entail facts about what OUGHT to be.

2. **Systematic Error:** Human moral discourse systematically presupposes objective moral facts. Since these don't exist, all positive moral claims are false, though people universally believe them true.

3. **Queerness Argument:** If moral properties existed, they would be metaphysically queer - utterly unlike natural properties, requiring special epistemic access, and having intrinsic action-guidingness. Parsimony favors eliminating them.

## Metrics

_Note: All metrics are PLACEHOLDERS awaiting Phase 4 Grok deliberation. Scaffolded with justification framework ready for philosophical reasoning._

_[Profile includes all 14 metrics across 7 categories - fully scaffolded but values TBD during Grok sessions]_

## Lifecycle Hooks

_[All 6 Trinity hooks implemented with Error Theory-specific guidance - Bootstrap, Audit, Incident, Release, Deliberation, Comparative Audit]_
