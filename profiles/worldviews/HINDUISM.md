## Philosophical Foundations

### Declared Axiom

Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma) encompasses diverse traditions sharing core concepts: Brahman (ultimate reality), atman (self/soul), karma (action and consequence), samsara (cycle of rebirth), dharma (cosmic/moral order), and moksha (liberation from samsara). The Vedas, Upanishads, and Bhagavad Gita are foundational texts.

### Philosophical Framework

Hinduism includes multiple philosophical schools: Advaita Vedanta (non-dualism - atman and Brahman are identical), Dvaita (dualism - atman and Brahman are distinct), Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism), Samkhya-Yoga, and others. Despite diversity, shared commitments include karma-samsara-moksha framework, authority of Vedic tradition, and pursuit of liberation through knowledge, devotion, or action.

### Key Principles

1. **Brahman:** Ultimate reality - infinite, eternal, unchanging ground of all existence. Approached as saguna (with qualities) or nirguna (without qualities/formless).

2. **Karma-Samsara:** Actions produce consequences (karma) binding atman to rebirth cycle (samsara). Liberation (moksha) transcends this cycle through knowledge, devotion, or yoga.

3. **Dharma:** Cosmic/moral order governing reality and ethics. Living in accordance with dharma (righteous duty) based on one's stage of life and social position is central.
