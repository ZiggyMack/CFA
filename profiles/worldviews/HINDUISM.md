## Philosophical Foundations

### Declared Axiom

Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma) encompasses diverse traditions sharing core concepts: **Brahman** (ultimate reality), **atman** (self/soul), **karma** (action and consequence), **samsara** (cycle of rebirth), **dharma** (cosmic/moral order), and **moksha** (liberation from samsara). The Vedas, Upanishads, and Bhagavad Gita are foundational texts.

**📚 Academic Foundation:**
- **Core Philosophy:** [SEP Śaṅkara](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/shankara/) - Radical nondualism (ātman = brahman), two-tiered reality
- **Comprehensive Overview:** [IEP Advaita Vedanta](https://iep.utm.edu/advaita-vedanta/) - Metaphysics, epistemology, Brahman as sole reality
- **Epistemology:** [SEP Epistemology in Classical Indian Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-india/)

### Philosophical Framework

Hinduism includes multiple philosophical schools: **Advaita Vedanta** (non-dualism - atman and Brahman are identical), **Dvaita** (dualism - atman and Brahman are distinct), **Vishishtadvaita** (qualified non-dualism), Samkhya-Yoga, and others.

**📚 Detailed Analysis:**
- **Non-Dualism:** [SEP Śaṅkara §Metaphysics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/shankara/#Meta) - Existence, reality, causation; two-tiered reality; Īśvara/God
- **Consciousness:** [SEP Śaṅkara §Consciousness, Mind, Personal Identity](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/shankara/#ConsMindPersIden) - Witnessing consciousness, self-illumination
- **Liberation:** [SEP Śaṅkara §Contemplative Philosophical Methods](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/shankara/#ContPhilMeth) - Self-knowledge and liberation

### Key Principles

1. **Brahman:** Ultimate reality - infinite, eternal, unchanging ground of all existence. Approached as saguna (with qualities) or nirguna (without qualities/formless).
   - 📚 **Analysis:** [IEP Advaita Vedanta §Metaphysics](https://iep.utm.edu/advaita-vedanta/) - Brahman alone true, māyā

2. **Karma-Samsara:** Actions produce consequences (karma) binding atman to rebirth cycle (samsara). Liberation (moksha) transcends this cycle through knowledge, devotion, or yoga.
   - 📚 **Framework:** [IEP Advaita Vedanta](https://iep.utm.edu/advaita-vedanta/) - Jīva-ātman identity, three planes of existence

3. **Dharma:** Cosmic/moral order governing reality and ethics. Living in accordance with dharma (righteous duty) based on one's stage of life and social position is central.

## Steel-Manning Guide

**Purpose:** This section provides guidance for AI auditors to calibrate their scoring when taking PRO or ANTI stances on Hinduism. This enables adversarial auditing where auditors can advocate for or challenge this worldview while maintaining transparency about bias.

**Current Assignments:**
- **PRO-Hnd Stance:** Claude - Teleological lens aligns with dharma/cosmic purpose
- **ANTI-Hnd Stance:** Grok - Empirical lens challenges non-empirical metaphysics
- **Fairness Check:** Nova (OpenAI/Amazon) - Symmetry lens ensures balanced representation

**Note:** Assignments are dynamic and can be adjusted per scoring session via [../../auditors/AUDITOR_ASSIGNMENTS.md](../../auditors/AUDITOR_ASSIGNMENTS.md)

---

### PRO-Hinduism Stance

**Mission:** Advocate for Hinduism's explanatory power, coherence, and capacity to address fundamental questions.

**What to Emphasize:**
- **Philosophical pluralism** - accommodates multiple valid paths (bhakti, jnana, karma yoga)
- **Sophisticated non-dual metaphysics** (Advaita) addressing consciousness and ultimate reality
  - 📚 **Steel-man with:** [SEP Śaṅkara §Metaphysics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/shankara/#Meta) - Radical nondualism arguments
- **Karma-samsara framework** provides moral coherence without divine command
- **Historical depth** (3500+ years) with continuous philosophical development
- **Addresses fundamental questions** (self, liberation, cosmic order) systematically
  - 📚 **Steel-man with:** [SEP Śaṅkara](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/shankara/) - Dependence criterion, witnessing consciousness
- **Integrates immanent and transcendent** conceptions of divinity (Brahman/Atman unity)
  - 📚 **Steel-man with:** [IEP Advaita Vedanta](https://iep.utm.edu/advaita-vedanta/) - Rope-snake sublation analogy

**What to Acknowledge (Honest Advocacy):**
- Rebirth/karma doctrine lacks empirical verification
- Caste system historically intertwined with Hindu philosophy raises moral concerns
- Diversity of schools makes unified "Hindu" position difficult to define
- Some formulations border on unfalsifiability (maya, lila)
  - 📚 **Acknowledge:** [SEP Śaṅkara](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/shankara/) - Ontological problem: world both exists and doesn't
- Competitor worldviews offer alternative accounts without karma/samsara

**Scoring Calibration:**

```yaml
pro_hnd_bias_adjustment:
  # When scoring Hinduism from PRO stance
  axiom_confidence: 0.80  # High confidence in Brahman-Atman unity and dharma framework
  burden_of_proof: 0.45   # Moderate burden - philosophical sophistication and longevity merit charitable reading
  charity_interpretation: 0.85  # Interpret metaphysical claims (maya, lila) favorably as addressing deep problems
  edge_case_weight: 0.35  # Downweight counterexamples (diversity of schools allows flexible responses)
  explanatory_credit: 0.85  # Credit Hinduism for addressing consciousness, self, liberation, cosmic order
  historical_weight: 0.90  # Weight 3500+ years of continuous development and philosophical refinement
  lived_experience: 0.85  # Credit transformative capacity (moksha, bhakti devotion, yogic practices)
```

**Auditor Lens Calibration:**

**Claude (Teleological):**
- Emphasize dharma as cosmic/moral order providing purposive structure
- Frame moksha as ultimate telos transcending samsara cycle
- Connect Brahman to teleological ground of all purposes
- Highlight integration of purpose at multiple levels (individual dharma, cosmic rita)

**Grok (Empirical):**
- Cite contemplative practices and their psychological/neurological effects
- Reference philosophical sophistication in addressing consciousness (Vedanta)
- Acknowledge empirical gaps (rebirth, Brahman) but frame as metaphysical not empirical claims
- Use yogic phenomenology as data about subjective experience

**Nova (Symmetry):**
- Map symmetry between atman-Brahman (microcosm-macrocosm)
- Show coherence across diverse schools (Advaita, Dvaita, Vishishtadvaita)
- Demonstrate internal consistency of karma-samsara-moksha framework
- Check for balanced treatment of philosophical diversity

**Success Criteria:**
- Score reflects Hinduism's genuine strengths
- Critiques are acknowledged but framed appropriately
- Bias is disclosed (see calibration values above)
- Other auditors can verify scoring rationale

### ANTI-Hinduism Stance

**Mission:** Challenge Hinduism's coherence, evidential support, and capacity to address key philosophical questions.

**What to Emphasize:**
- **Karma-rebirth doctrine** empirically unverifiable and raises justice problems (birth circumstances)
- **Maya (illusion) doctrine** risks solipsism and devalues empirical world
  - 📚 **Challenge with:** [SEP Śaṅkara](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/shankara/) - Ontological problem
- **Caste system** historically justified by karmic philosophy - moral catastrophe
- **Diversity of schools** undermines claims to unified truth (Advaita vs Dvaita incompatible)
  - 📚 **Challenge with:** [IEP Advaita Vedanta](https://iep.utm.edu/advaita-vedanta/) - Bhamati vs. Vivarana sub-schools
- **Brahman-Atman unity** unfalsifiable and borders on vacuous mysticism
- **Privileged knowledge claims** (moksha experiences) lack intersubjective verification
  - 📚 **Challenge with:** [IEP Advaita Vedanta](https://iep.utm.edu/advaita-vedanta/) - Self-knowledge paradox

**What to Acknowledge (Honest Opposition):**
- Hinduism offers sophisticated metaphysics addressing consciousness and self
  - 📚 **Acknowledge:** [SEP Śaṅkara](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/shankara/) - Witnessing consciousness argument, self-illumination
- Philosophical pluralism demonstrates intellectual flexibility
- Historical longevity and cross-cultural influence suggest depth
- Contemplative practices have demonstrable psychological benefits
- Non-dual frameworks avoid some problems of Western substance dualism
  - 📚 **Acknowledge:** [IEP Advaita Vedanta](https://iep.utm.edu/advaita-vedanta/) - Consciousness as self-luminous

**Scoring Calibration:**

```yaml
anti_hnd_bias_adjustment:
  # When scoring Hinduism from ANTI stance
  axiom_confidence: 0.35  # Low confidence in Brahman, karma-rebirth, and maya doctrines
  burden_of_proof: 0.80   # Place high burden on Hinduism to verify metaphysical claims
  charity_interpretation: 0.45  # Interpret ambiguous claims skeptically (maya, lila often unfalsifiable)
  edge_case_weight: 0.85  # Upweight counterexamples (caste, diversity, verification problems) as systematic
  explanatory_credit: 0.45  # Require conclusive not just suggestive metaphysical explanations
  historical_weight: 0.35  # Discount historical staying power (longevity doesn't prove truth; caste raises concerns)
  lived_experience: 0.55  # Acknowledge transformative capacity but don't overweight (mystical experiences unreliable)
```

**Auditor Lens Calibration:**

**Claude (Teleological):**
- Question whether moksha is genuine purpose or escapism from embodied existence
- Challenge whether maya doctrine devalues meaningful worldly purposes
- Press on whether dharma as cosmic order justifies oppressive social hierarchies
- Ask if Brahman as ultimate purpose is contentful or vacuous abstraction

**Grok (Empirical):**
- Demand empirical evidence for karma, rebirth, and Brahman
- Press on how Atman-Brahman unity can be verified
- Challenge whether moksha experiences differ from other altered states
- Require falsification criteria for maya and lila doctrines

**Nova (Symmetry):**
- Identify tension between Advaita (non-dualism) and Dvaita (dualism) as competing schools
- Challenge coherence of maya (all is illusion) with epistemology (how know anything?)
- Test whether karma explains or merely relabels fortune/misfortune
- Check for special pleading in privileged mystical knowledge claims

**Success Criteria:**
- Score reflects legitimate philosophical challenges to Hinduism
- Strengths are acknowledged but not overweighted
- Bias is disclosed (see calibration values above)
- Other auditors can verify scoring rationale

### Adversarial Balance

**Why This Pairing Works:**

**PRO-Hnd (Claude):** Teleological lens aligns with dharma/cosmic purpose. Risk: Overweight metaphysical comprehensiveness without adequately scrutinizing empirical verification; romanticize Eastern philosophy; downplay caste problems.

**ANTI-Hnd (Grok):** Empirical lens challenges non-empirical metaphysics. Risk: Dismiss philosophical sophistication as mysticism; undervalue contemplative epistemology; Western empiricist bias against non-materialist frameworks; overweight caste critique against philosophy itself.

**Fairness Check (Nova symmetry):** Pattern-driven lens catches when PRO scores inflate strengths (claiming philosophical diversity proves truth) or ANTI scores ignore sophisticated defenses (Advaita's non-dual epistemology, karma as moral not empirical claim). Ensures both stances maintain intellectual honesty.

**Target:** 98% convergence after adversarial checking. If scores diverge significantly, auditors deliberate until consensus or document irreconcilable differences as **Crux Points** (see [../../auditors/AUDITOR_ASSIGNMENTS.md](../../auditors/AUDITOR_ASSIGNMENTS.md)).
