## Philosophical Foundations

### Declared Axiom

Islam begins with the Shahada: There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger. Allah is the one, eternal, transcendent Creator; the Quran is His final revelation to humanity; submission to Allah's will through the Five Pillars and Sharia leads to paradise.

### Philosophical Framework

Islam operates within strict monotheism (tawhid), emphasizing divine unity, transcendence, and sovereignty. Core Islamic philosophy developed through kalam (theology), falsafa (philosophy influenced by Greek thought), and Sufism (mystical tradition). The tradition includes diverse schools (Sunni, Shia, Sufi) but shares core commitments to Quranic authority, prophetic tradition (hadith), and Islamic law (Sharia).

### Key Principles

1. **Tawhid:** Absolute divine unity and transcendence. Allah alone is worthy of worship; shirk (associating partners with Allah) is the gravest sin.

2. **Prophetic Authority:** Muhammad is the seal of the prophets; the Quran is Allah's final, uncorrupted revelation guiding humanity to submission.

3. **Ummah:** The global Muslim community bound by shared faith, practice, and submission to Allah. Justice, compassion, and accountability define Islamic ethics.
