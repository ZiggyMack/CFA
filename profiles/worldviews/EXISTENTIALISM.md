## Philosophical Foundations

### Declared Axiom

Existentialism begins with the axiom that "existence precedes essence" - humans are not created with predetermined nature or purpose, but rather find themselves thrown (Heidegger's Geworfenheit) into existence and must create meaning through free choice. The universe is absurd (Camus) or meaningless by default; humans face radical freedom and responsibility to define themselves through authentic action.

### Philosophical Framework

Existentialism (particularly atheistic existentialism of Sartre, Camus, de Beauvoir) emphasizes radical freedom, individual responsibility, authenticity vs bad faith, and confrontation with absurdity, death, and meaninglessness. Humans are "condemned to be free" - no external authority (God, nature, society) determines who we are; we create ourselves through choices. Existential angst/anxiety arises from recognition of this radical freedom and responsibility.

### Key Principles

1. **Existence Precedes Essence:** Humans exist first, then define themselves through choices. No predetermined human nature or purpose; meaning is created, not discovered.

2. **Radical Freedom and Responsibility:** Humans are radically free; every choice defines who we are. We cannot escape responsibility for our lives by appealing to determinism, social roles, or divine will.

3. **Authenticity vs Bad Faith:** Authentic existence confronts freedom and creates meaning honestly; bad faith denies freedom through self-deception, conformity, or appeals to external authority.
