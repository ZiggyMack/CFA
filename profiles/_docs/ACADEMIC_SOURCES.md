# Academic Sources Reference Map

**Purpose:** Maps each CFA worldview profile to 3-5 authoritative academic sources (primarily Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy). This enables hyperlink-based profiles that reference expert scholarship rather than duplicating content.

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-10
**Owner:** Process Claude
**Bootstrap Creator:** Doc Claude (one-time content refactor)
**Update Frequency:** As needed when worldviews added, sources change, or better academic references discovered
**Validation:** Automated link checking via Audit lifecycle hooks (Process Claude orchestrates via VUDU protocol)

**Process Claude Duties:**
1. **Pre-Scoring Validation (VUDU Step 1):** Check academic sources are live for worldview being scored
2. **Post-Scoring Updates:** Document source improvements discovered during auditor deliberation
3. **New Worldview Addition:** Coordinate source mapping for new profiles (bootstrap with Doc Claude)
4. **Quarterly Health Check:** Review for broken links, assess coverage quality, report degraded sources to Shaman Claude

**Cross-Reference:** See [docs/repository/librarian_tools/ROLE_PROCESS.md](../../docs/repository/librarian_tools/ROLE_PROCESS.md) Domain 7 for Process Claude's worldview profile monitoring procedures

## 18. Mormonism (Latter-day Saints)

### Primary Sources

**1. Encyclopedia of Mormonism (BYU) - Philosophy**
- **URL:** https://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Philosophy

### Content Mapping
- **Core Commitments:** Eternal progression, rejection of ex nihilo creation, material/physical nature of God and spirit, human potential for exaltation, continuing revelation
- **PRO Arguments:** Optimistic anthropology (humans as potential gods), coherent theodicy (God limited by eternal laws), unique scriptures provide fresh theological perspective
- **ANTI Criticisms:** Non-mainstream Christian theology (finite God, material deity), recent origin limits historical depth, verification of unique revelatory claims, anthropomorphic God risks philosophical incoherence
- **Key Debates:** LDS as Christian or new religion, finite vs. classical theism, nature of revelation and prophetic authority

### Assessment: **Good** - No SEP/IEP coverage (typical for newer religious movements), but authoritative LDS academic sources available (EoM, SMPT)

## Usage Guidelines for CFA Profiles

### Hyperlink Strategy

1. **Primary Reference Model:** Link to main encyclopedia articles for foundational worldview exposition rather than duplicating content

2. **Section-Specific Deep Links:** Use anchor links (especially in SEP) to direct users to specific arguments, objections, or debates

3. **Multi-Source Approach:** For critical concepts, provide 2-3 complementary links:
   - SEP for systematic philosophical analysis
   - IEP for accessible overview
   - Specialized articles for deep dives

4. **Inline Citation Format:** Use markdown links with descriptive text:
   - Example: "See [SEP Divine Simplicity §2.1](url) for the five primary motivations"
   - Example: "For objections, consult [IEP Open Theism - Philosophical Considerations](url)"

5. **Profile Content Architecture:**
   - **Core Commitments section:** Link to main articles + specific metaphysics/epistemology/ethics sections
   - **PRO Stance Calibration:** Link to arguments FOR sections
   - **ANTI Stance Calibration:** Link to criticisms/objections sections
   - **Crux Points:** Link to key debates showing unresolved tensions

### What to Keep In-Repo vs. Link

**Keep:**
- Steel-Manning Guide structure (PRO/ANTI stance calibrations)
- Bias adjustment YAML blocks (quantified scoring parameters)
- CFA-specific cross-references (how this worldview relates to others in OUR framework)
- Brief 2-3 sentence summaries (orientation for users)
- Auditor coordination notes

**Link:**
- Long philosophical expositions
- Detailed arguments
- Historical context
- Scholarly debates
- Key figure biographies

### Quality Assurance

All sources in this reference map are:
- ✅ Peer-reviewed academic philosophy encyclopedias (SEP and IEP gold standard)
- ✅ Authored by subject-matter expert philosophers
- ✅ Regularly updated and maintained
- ✅ Freely accessible online
- ✅ Structured with clear sections and (for SEP) anchor links

---

**Maintenance Protocol:** When academic sources update or new authoritative articles emerge, Doc_Claude should update this reference map and notify relevant profiles for hyperlink updates.
