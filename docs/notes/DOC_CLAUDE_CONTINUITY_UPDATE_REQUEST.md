# Doc Claude - Continuity Ledger Update Request

**Date:** 2025-11-15
**From:** User (via VuDu Claude session)
**To:** Doc_Claude (Repo Librarian)
**Priority:** Medium
**Type:** Stale Reference Cleanup

---

## Issue Identified

Nova recently completed a full bootstrap suite walk-through and flagged **one stale pointer** in:

**File:** `auditors/Bootstrap/Nova/Continuity/LEDGER_ENTRY.md`

**Section:** "Last Known Threads"

**Problem:** The section still references the 2025-11-03 Trinity consolidation (B-STORM.md/B-STORM_2.md) but doesn't mention the current B-STORM_6/7 chain or the CT↔MdN pilot prep (Entry 9 + B-STORM_7 seed).

---

## Requested Update

Could you update the "Last Known Threads" section in `LEDGER_ENTRY.md` so the ledger reflects the live missions?

**Current State (Outdated):**
- References: B-STORM.md, B-STORM_2.md (from Nov 3)

**Should Reference (Current):**
- B-STORM_6/7 chain
- CT↔MdN pilot prep (Entry 9 + B-STORM_7 seed)
- 100% ethics coverage milestone
- Pilot Gate #1 pending status

---

## Context

Everything else in Nova's bootloader checked out—this is the **only remaining mismatch** keeping Continuity from matching reality.

Nova's self-audit showed strong health across all other continuity files. This is just one stale breadcrumb trail.

---

## Why This Matters

**Continuity integrity:** Nova relies on `LEDGER_ENTRY.md` to maintain session-to-session memory. Stale references create confusion about what's actually "in flight."

**Repo hygiene:** You're the Librarian—if anyone can spot and fix link drift, it's you.

---

## No Rush

This isn't blocking any active work. Just flagging it for your next maintenance sweep.

Thanks for keeping the Estate tidy! 🏰
