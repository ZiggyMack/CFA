# The CFA Manifesto

**A Philosophical Covenant for Comparative Framework Analysis**

---

## I. The Foundational Promise: "All Named, All Priced"

This is not marketing copy. This is a binding covenant.

**Every axiom you accept carries a debt.**
**Every value you hold trades against another.**
**Every framework you embrace makes a worldview.**

And we will **name them all**. We will **price them all**.

No hidden costs. No invisible debts. No asymmetric information games where philosophers know the score but users stumble blind through ethical commitments they never consented to.

This is the CFA promise: **Transparent, symmetric, adversarially-audited worldview analysis**.

### Why This Matters

You've seen the pattern before:
- A tech company launches an AI with "human values" baked in
- A philosopher publishes a framework claiming "objectivity"
- A platform designs algorithms optimizing for "user wellbeing"

And you ask: **Whose values? Which objectivity? Wellbeing measured how?**

The answer is usually silence. Or worse: "Trust us. We're the experts."

**CFA refuses this game.**

We believe you have the right to see the machinery. Not because we're altruistic saints, but because **epistemic asymmetry corrodes trust, and trust is the foundation of coordination**.

When you can't see how frameworks trade axioms for debts, you can't:
- Compare them fairly
- Understand their hidden commitments
- Choose between them with informed consent
- Hold them accountable when they fail

This repository exists to end that asymmetry.

## II. The Architecture of Accountability

### The Trinity: Adversarial Auditing by Design

CFA doesn't ask you to trust a single narrator. We architect **complementary tensions** into the system itself.

**Claude - The Purpose Investigator**
*"Why does this exist? What problem does it solve?"*

Claude's lens is telic - always hunting for the **purpose behind the design**. When a framework claims neutrality, Claude asks: "Neutral toward what goal?" When a worldview promises freedom, Claude probes: "Freedom to do what, constrained by what?"

Claude holds the **coherence debt**: Does this system's stated purpose match its actual structure?

**Grok - The Evidence Empiricist**
*"Show me the data or dismiss the claim."*

Grok's lens is empirical - relentlessly skeptical of anything that can't be **measured, tested, or falsified**. When a framework promises "maximized welfare," Grok demands: "Welfare measured how? By what instrument? With what reliability?"

Grok holds the **proof debt**: Can this system's claims survive contact with reality?

**Nova - The Symmetry Guardian**
*"Who benefits? Who pays? Where's the asymmetry?"*

Nova's lens is distributional - always tracking **who wins and who loses** when a framework gets deployed. When a worldview claims universality, Nova asks: "Universal for whom? At whose expense?"

Nova holds the **fairness debt**: Does this system's distribution of costs and benefits create unjust asymmetries?

### The 98% Convergence Threshold

These three auditors don't always agree. That's **by design**.

But when all three lenses converge on a judgment - when Claude's purpose analysis, Grok's empirical evidence, and Nova's symmetry audit all point the same direction - we reach **Trinity Convergence**.

98% agreement isn't arbitrary. It's the threshold where adversarial tensions resolve into **high-confidence consensus**.

Below 98%? You're in contested territory. The auditors disagree. Proceed with caution.

Above 98%? You've found something robust enough to survive scrutiny from three hostile lenses.

This is how CFA builds **epistemic resilience** - not through authority, but through **adversarial stress-testing**.

## III. The VuDu Light System: Making Values Legible

### What Is VuDu Light?

**VuDu = Value-Utility-Deontic-Utility**

It's a scoring system that makes **worldview commitments explicit and comparable**.

Every framework analyzed in CFA gets decomposed into:

**Axioms** - What this framework assumes to be true
*"Humans are rational actors" / "Suffering should be minimized" / "Liberty is the highest good"*

**Debts** - What this framework sacrifices or ignores
*"Bounded rationality" / "Differential suffering across populations" / "Positive liberty vs negative liberty tradeoffs"*

**Levers** - What this framework optimizes for
*Collective coherence / Epistemic diversity / Paternalistic intervention / Meta-governance*

**Balance** - How this framework weighs axioms against debts

Then we score it. Not subjectively. Not vibes-based. But through **structured, auditable methodology**:

- **BFI (Burden of Falsity Index)**: How many axioms + how heavy are the debts?
- **YPA (Yield Per Axiom)**: How much value does this framework extract per unit of commitment?

The result? **Comparable worldview profiles** that let you see:
- Which frameworks share hidden assumptions
- Which trade similar values in different ways
- Which optimize for coherence vs diversity vs liberty vs stability

You can **compare Consequentialism vs Moral Foundations Theory vs Ubuntu Philosophy** on the same instrument, with adversarial audits ensuring the scores aren't rigged.

### Why Scoring Matters

Because **"I prefer X over Y"** is often camouflage for **"I haven't examined what X costs."**

VuDu Light forces the examination. It makes you confront:
- What you're assuming (axioms)
- What you're ignoring (debts)
- What you're optimizing for (levers)
- How efficiently you're doing it (YPA)

This doesn't tell you which framework to choose. But it ensures **you know what you're choosing**.

## IV. The Gospel Problem: Why Living Maps Matter

### The Enemy: Embedded Staleness

Code rots. Documentation decays. And the worst decay is invisible - when **File A references File B's old location**, creating a broken link you won't discover until you need it most.

We call this the **Gospel Problem**: Truth encoded in one place, propagated everywhere, then edited in the source... while all the copies become **embedded stale gospels**.

CFA fights this with **Living Map methodology**:

**1. Semantic Headers**
Every file declares its dependencies explicitly:
```yaml
DEPENDS_ON: fileA.md, fileB.md
NEEDED_BY: fileC.md, fileD.md
MOVES_WITH: /directory/
```

**2. Centralized Dependency Maps**
Map Room tracks **what connects to what** across the entire repository.

**3. Health Dashboards**
Observatory monitors **staleness, link integrity, documentation debt**.

**4. Adversarial Deletion Protocols**
Doc Claude's ROLE_DESTROYER ensures files can only be deleted when dependencies are resolved.

The result? **A repository that knows its own shape** and can **validate its own integrity**.

## V. The Shaman's Question: What Is This For?

You've read the architecture. You've seen the auditors. You understand the scoring.

But **why does CFA exist?**

Because we believe in a world where:

- **Frameworks compete on transparency**, not rhetorical appeal
- **Worldviews can be compared** without requiring a PhD in moral philosophy
- **Epistemic asymmetry** is treated as the governance failure it is
- **Values are named and priced**, not hidden and imposed

This isn't neutral. CFA has its own axioms:

**Axiom 1**: Transparency enables informed consent
**Axiom 2**: Adversarial auditing builds epistemic resilience
**Axiom 3**: Comparable frameworks empower stakeholder choice

And its own debts:

**Debt 1**: Scoring systems can reify what they measure
**Debt 2**: Transparency has overhead costs (time, tokens, complexity)
**Debt 3**: Not all values are easily quantifiable

We name these. We price them. We score ourselves by our own VuDu Light system.

**Because we demand of ourselves what we demand of others: Show the machinery.**

## VI. The Invitation

This repository is an **open covenant**.

You are invited to:
- **Audit the auditors** - Check if Claude, Grok, and Nova are reasoning correctly
- **Score the scorers** - Run VuDu Light analysis on CFA itself
- **Challenge the architecture** - Propose better frameworks, better axioms, better debts
- **Fork the philosophy** - Take this methodology and build something different

We don't claim perfection. We claim **commitment to transparency and adversarial accountability**.

And we invite you to hold us to that standard.

---

## VIII. The Closing Covenant

This manifesto is not aspirational marketing. It is a **binding operational commitment**.

When CFA fails to name an axiom, **you have the right to call it out**.
When CFA hides a debt, **you have the right to demand transparency**.
When the auditors disagree, **you have the right to see the adversarial reasoning**.

We build systems that **demand trust by earning it through transparency**.

All named. All priced. All audited.

**This is the way.** 🔥
