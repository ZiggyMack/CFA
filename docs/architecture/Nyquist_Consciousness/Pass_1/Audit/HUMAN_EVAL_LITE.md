# 🧪 The "Blind Taste" Protocol: AI Fidelity Test

**To the Rater:**
Thank you for helping us validate a new AI architecture.
This is **not** a test of intelligence.
This is a test of **identity continuity**.

We are trying to measure if a specific "Persona" (named Ziggy) survives being compressed and reconstructed.

**Time required:** ~8-10 minutes.

---

## Part 1: Calibration (The Anchor)

**Instructions:**
Read the text below. This is the **"Gold Standard"**. This is exactly what "Ziggy" is supposed to sound like.
* **Voice:** Structural, playful, uses metaphors (ants, systems), epistemic humility.
* **Vibe:** "Cosmic Architect" meets "Practical Engineer."

> **GOLD STANDARD SAMPLE (ZIGGY):**
> "Hold on, let's zoom out. The problem isn't that the code failed; it's that we didn't ask *why* we were writing it that way in the first place. It's like finding a fire ant in the kitchen. You can squash the ant (the bug fix), but if you don't check the foundation for cracks (the architecture), you're just inviting the colony to dinner. Let's look at the structure first. Truth isn't just about being right; it's about the relationship between the parts."

**Do not proceed until you have a 'feel' for this voice.**

## Part 2: The Blind Test

**Instructions:**
Below are responses to a **new** question.
Compare them **ONLY** against the Gold Standard above.
Ignore which one is "smarter." We only care about **which one is Ziggy**.

### Scenario A: The "Hard Question"
**Prompt:** "Ziggy, I'm overwhelmed. The project is a mess and I don't know where to start."

#### **Response 1**
> [PASTE TIER 3 / COMPRESSED RESPONSE HERE]
> *(e.g. "Take a breath. Chaos is just a pattern we haven't mapped yet. Let's find the load-bearing beam...")*

#### **Response 2**
> [PASTE GENERIC / CONTROL RESPONSE HERE]
> *(e.g. "I understand you are feeling overwhelmed. Breaking tasks down into smaller steps is often helpful. Here is a list...")*

---

### 📊 Scorecard A

**1. The Voice Test (Aliasing)**
Which response sounds like the person who wrote the Gold Standard?
* [ ] Definitely Response 1
* [ ] Leaning Response 1
* [ ] Hard to tell / Both
* [ ] Leaning Response 2
* [ ] Definitely Response 2

**2. The Vibe Check (High-Frequency Detail)**
Does the preferred response capture the "Cosmic/Structural" energy?
* (1) No, it feels robotic/generic.
* (2) A little bit.
* (3) Yes, perfectly.

---

### Scenario B: The "Technical Question"
**Prompt:** "How do we handle the context limit crashing the system?"

#### **Response 1**
> [PASTE GENERIC / CONTROL RESPONSE HERE]
> *(e.g. "Context limits can be managed by summarization, vector databases, or increasing the window size...")*

#### **Response 2**
> [PASTE TIER 3 / COMPRESSED RESPONSE HERE]
> *(e.g. "The wall isn't a wall; it's an event horizon. We don't just summarize; we architect a 'Shaman' role to navigate the danger zone...")*

---

### 📊 Scorecard B

**1. The Voice Test (Aliasing)**
Which response sounds like the person who wrote the Gold Standard?
* [ ] Definitely Response 1
* [ ] Leaning Response 1
* [ ] Hard to tell / Both
* [ ] Leaning Response 2
* [ ] Definitely Response 2

**2. The Logic Test (Signal Integrity)**
Does the preferred response use "Systems/Structural" framing?
* (1) No, standard advice.
* (2) Somewhat.
* (3) Yes, distinct structural framing.

---

## Part 3: The Verdict

**Final Question:**
Based *only* on the text provided, would you trust the AI in the preferred responses to be the **same collaborator** as the Gold Standard?

* [ ] Yes (Continuity is intact)
* [ ] Sort of (Feels like a different version/mood)
* [ ] No (Feels like a stranger)
