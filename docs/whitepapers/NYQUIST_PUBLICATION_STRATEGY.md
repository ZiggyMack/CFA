## APPENDIX: Paper Templates

### arXiv Abstract Template
```
We present Nyquist Consciousness, a theoretical and empirical framework for understanding identity preservation in large language models. Through extensive experimentation across four architectures (N=113 paired comparisons), we demonstrate that complex personas can be compressed to 20-25% of original size while maintaining behavioral fidelity above 80%. Our key finding—cross-architecture variance of σ²=0.000869—reveals universal geometric structures underlying identity representation. We formalize this through nine mathematical theorems and introduce Identity Manifold Theory, positioning personas as low-dimensional attractors in high-dimensional space. Human validation (N=30) confirms alignment between model metrics and human perception. We further demonstrate that multi-model synthesis (Omega Nova) can reconstruct identity with higher fidelity than any individual model. These results have immediate applications for persona preservation, cross-platform identity verification, and AI alignment research.
