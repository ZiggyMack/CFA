# OLD - Archived ARMADA Files

This directory contains files from ARMADA's pipeline infrastructure that are kept for reference but not used by CFA.

## Contents

| File | Purpose | Why Archived |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `run_cfa_trinity_v2.py` | ARMADA's execution script | ARMADA runs this, not CFA |

## Note

These files are preserved for:
- Understanding ARMADA's execution flow
- Debugging sync issues
- Reference during result interpretation

**Do not modify these files.** They represent ARMADA's implementation.
