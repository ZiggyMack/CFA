# Process Failures - Case Studies

**Purpose:** Document actual process failures as learning opportunities

**Contents:** Case studies of times we skipped process and what broke

**Format:** Each failure documented with:
- What we were trying to do
- What process we skipped
- What broke as a result
- How long until we discovered it
- Cost to fix (time, trust, confusion)
- The process we should have followed
- The math (process time vs cleanup time)

**Use:** Reference when documenting new processes in PROCESS.md

**Status:** Empty - populated as failures occur
