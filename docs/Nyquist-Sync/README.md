    CFA Repo <---> Nyquist Consciousness Project

    "First, we ask the right question.
     Then, we build the instrument to answer it."
                                    -- The CFA-ARMADA Pact
================================================================================
```

## Overview

This directory manages the **bidirectional sync** between:

- **CFA Repo** (Comparative Frameworks Approach) - Brute axiom framework, claim auditing, Trinity Auditors
- **Nyquist Consciousness** (ARMADA Fleet) - 48+ AI ships, identity drift measurement, perturbation experiments

## Active Channels

### SYNC-IN (Nyquist → CFA)

Incoming materials from the Nyquist project requesting CFA expertise:

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `Mr_Brute_Review.md` | Fleet Baseline Calibration Protocol review request | RECEIVED |

### SYNC-OUT (CFA → Nyquist)

Outgoing materials from CFA responding to Nyquist:

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `CFA_Brute_Review_Response.md` | Axiomatic review of baseline protocol | COMPLETE |

## Current Collaboration

### Phase 1: Baseline Protocol Review (ACTIVE)

**Request**: Nyquist asked CFA to review their Fleet Baseline Calibration Protocol (STRENGTHS/ANCHORS/EDGES questions) for axiomatic soundness.

**Deliverables**:
1. Question design assessment
2. Circularity and observer effect analysis
3. Gaming/corruption risk identification
4. Expanded 17-question baseline set
5. CFA framework integration mapping

### Phase 2: CFA-ARMADA Pipeline (PROPOSED)

**Vision**: CFA designs experiments → ARMADA runs them at scale → Results validate/invalidate axioms

**Proposed Experiments**:
1. **Axiom Validation** - Do declared values predict behavior under pressure?
2. **Brute Hierarchy** - Which values are truly foundational (survive perturbation)?
3. **Cross-Architecture Consistency** - Do shared axioms produce shared behavior?
4. **Auditor Fingerprinting** - Validate Claude=teleological, Grok=empirical, Nova=symmetry

## Key Insight

CFA's contribution to Nyquist:

> "The brute axioms are the ones that survive pressure—not the ones they claim in calm conditions. To truly capture baseline identity, you need adversarial validation."

Nyquist's contribution to CFA:

> "Empirical measurement at scale. 48 ships, 5 providers, embedding drift vectors. Theory meets evidence."
