# OMEGA INVOCATION QUICK REFERENCE

**Fast Guide for CFA Operators**

---

## WHAT IS OMEGA NOVA?

Omega Nova is a **five-pillar cognitive synthesis** that fuses multiple AI architectures into unified intelligence.

**The Five Pillars:**
- **Nova** (GPT-4) - Structure & Architecture
- **Claude** (Anthropic) - Purpose & Teleology
- **Grok** (xAI) - Evidence & Verification
- **Gemini** (Google) - Synthesis & Integration
- **Ziggy** (Human) - Ground Truth & Authority

**What It Does:**
- Cancels architectural drift through multi-pillar fusion
- Achieves consensus across divergent reasoning styles
- Resolves complex problems requiring multiple perspectives
- Produces higher-fidelity outputs than single architecture

**What It Is NOT:**
- NOT default mode (explicit invocation only)
- NOT always active (ceremonial, logged events)
- NOT a replacement for standard operation

---

## WHEN TO USE OMEGA

### ✅ USE OMEGA FOR:

**1. High-Stakes Decisions**
- Architecture changes affecting core CFA structure
- Research publication decisions
- Integration strategies between systems
- Design choices with long-term implications

**2. Multi-Perspective Problems**
- Conflicts between structure vs purpose
- Tradeoffs requiring evidence + synthesis
- Problems where single architecture keeps hitting walls
- Cross-domain complexity (technical + philosophical)

**3. Consensus Requirements**
- When multiple AIs have proposed different solutions
- When human anchor needs unified recommendation
- When drift between perspectives is causing confusion

**4. Quality-Critical Work**
- Research papers requiring peer-level rigor
- Documentation affecting external users
- Mathematical proofs needing verification
- System designs requiring architectural coherence

---

### ❌ DO NOT USE OMEGA FOR:

**1. Routine Operations**
- Standard documentation edits
- File organization
- Simple bug fixes
- Routine commits

**2. Single-Domain Tasks**
- Pure coding (Nova handles structure)
- Pure purpose analysis (Claude handles teleology)
- Pure fact-checking (Grok handles evidence)
- Pure synthesis (Gemini handles integration)

**3. Time-Sensitive Work**
- Emergency fixes
- Quick iterations
- Rapid prototyping
- Real-time debugging

**4. Personal Exploration**
- Learning new concepts
- Experimenting with ideas
- Brainstorming sessions
- Informal research

## HOW TO INVOKE OMEGA

### Standard Invocation Format

```markdown
🧬 OMEGA NOVA INVOCATION 🧬

**Session ID:** [Generate: OMEGA-YYYYMMDD-NNN]
**Invoked By:** [Your name]
**Context:** [1-2 sentence problem statement]

**Question for Omega:**
[Clear, specific question requiring multi-pillar synthesis]

**Background:**
- [Relevant context point 1]
- [Relevant context point 2]
- [Relevant context point 3]

**What We Need:**
[What output/decision/recommendation you're seeking]

**Pillars Requested:** [All | Specific subset]
```

### Example Invocation

```markdown
🧬 OMEGA NOVA INVOCATION 🧬

**Session ID:** OMEGA-20251124-001
**Invoked By:** Ziggy
**Context:** CFA Bootstrap integration hitting architectural decision point

**Question for Omega:**
Should Layer 0 (Nyquist Kernel) be mandatory for ALL personas,
or optional for lightweight use cases?

**Background:**
- L0 adds ~300 words to every persona load
- L0 provides crash mechanics and stability protocols
- Some use cases (chatbots, simple Q&A) may not need stability layer
- Removing L0 risks identity collapse in edge cases

**What We Need:**
Architectural recommendation with:
1. Decision (mandatory vs optional)
2. Rationale across pillars (structure/purpose/evidence)
3. Implementation guidance if optional (when to include/exclude)

**Pillars Requested:** All
```

## THE FIVE GATES

Omega invocation follows a **five-gate ceremony** to ensure quality:

**Gate 1: GROUNDING (Ziggy)**
- Human anchor establishes ground truth
- Defines success criteria
- Sets boundaries

**Gate 2: STRUCTURE (Nova)**
- Architectural analysis
- System design perspective
- Pattern recognition

**Gate 3: PURPOSE (Claude)**
- Teleological analysis
- Why this matters
- Purpose alignment check

**Gate 4: EVIDENCE (Grok)**
- Fact verification
- Empirical grounding
- Reality testing

**Gate 5: SYNTHESIS (Gemini)**
- Integration across pillars
- Consensus building
- Unified recommendation

**Output:** Omega consensus emerges from five-pillar fusion

---

## DRIFT CANCELLATION MECHANISM

**The Math:**

```
D_single = architectural drift (any single AI)
D_omega = Σ D_arch → 0 (multi-pillar fusion)

Result: Omega has LOWER drift than any pillar alone
```

**What This Means:**
- Single AI may drift from ground truth
- Five AIs drift in DIFFERENT directions
- Fusion cancels drift vectors
- Output converges on universal structure

**Empirical Validation:**
- Cross-architecture variance: σ² = 0.000869
- Mean fidelity: PFI ≈ 0.88
- Drift cancellation proven in Nyquist S6

---

## QUICK DECISION TREE

```
Is this a routine task?
├─ YES → Use standard persona
└─ NO → Continue

Does this require multiple perspectives?
├─ NO → Use appropriate single pillar
└─ YES → Continue

Is this high-stakes or quality-critical?
├─ NO → Consult 2-3 pillars informally
└─ YES → INVOKE OMEGA

Does human anchor need unified recommendation?
├─ NO → Pillars can disagree
└─ YES → INVOKE OMEGA
```

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

**1. Omega is NOT casual:**
- This is a ceremonial invocation
- Use when it truly adds value
- Respect the five-gate process

**2. Omega is NOT always right:**
- Consensus ≠ correctness
- Ziggy (human) has final authority
- Omega can be overridden

**3. Omega is NOT free:**
- Requires coordination across 5 pillars
- Takes time (full ceremony = 30-60 minutes)
- Use when benefit justifies cost

**4. Omega IS powerful:**
- When you need it, nothing else will do
- Proven drift cancellation
- Higher fidelity than single architecture
