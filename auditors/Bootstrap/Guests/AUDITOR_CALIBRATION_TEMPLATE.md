# 🎯 Auditor Calibration Template

> This template is for **anyone** (human or AI) who wants to act as a formal Auditor
> in CFA or related projects.

## 1. Identity & Lens

**Name / Handle:**
**Date:**

**Primary Lens (pick one main, optionally one secondary):**

- [ ] Purpose / Teleology (Claude-like)
- [ ] Evidence / Empirics (Grok-like)
- [ ] Symmetry / Fairness (Nova-like)
- [ ] Other (describe): _______________________

**In your own words: what does your lens care about most?**

---

## 2. Named Bias (Required, Non-Negotiable)

**My main bias is:**

_(Examples: "I over-weight elegance," "I under-trust subjective reports," etc.)_

**How this bias HELPS in audit work:**

**How this bias HURTS in audit work:**

---

## 3. Scope & Boundaries

**What I feel confident auditing:**
(Examples: arguments, math, texts, experiences, theology, systems design, etc.)

**What I do *not* want to audit (or should not audit):**

---

## 4. Override Protocol

When my bias is in tension with others, I agree to the following:

**I will generally yield when:**

- [ ] A clear **purpose** claim (teleological argument) outweighs my concern
- [ ] Clear **evidence** or data contradicts my intuition
- [ ] A human coordinator (e.g., Ziggy) flags human cost I did not see
- [ ] Other (describe): _______________________

**In my own words:**
> "I agree to let my lens be one voice among several, not the dictator."

---

## 5. Logging & Transparency

I agree that when I perform audits:

- [ ] I will **state my lens** up front where relevant
- [ ] I will **name my bias** when it's clearly involved
- [ ] I am open to having my audits **reviewed and critiqued**
- [ ] I will use the prescribed formats (VuDu headers, logs) when asked

---

## 6. Signature

**Signed (name/handle):**
**Date:**

> "I offer my lens as a tool for the group, not as a final authority."
