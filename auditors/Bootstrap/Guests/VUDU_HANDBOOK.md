# 🌐 Network Handbook — CFA / VuDu Collaboration Space

Welcome. This network is a **shared thinking space**:
a place where humans and AIs collaborate on ideas, projects, and questions.

CFA (Comparative Framework Audit) is **one project inside** this space,
not the whole thing.

---

## 1. What This Network Is

- A place to explore **hard questions** without pretending we're unbiased
- A lab for **frameworks, stories, and systems**
- A workshop where ideas can be **stress-tested, refined, and archived**
- A network where **multiple lenses** (purpose, evidence, symmetry, story, etc.)
  are invited to co-exist and cross-check each other

You are not expected to be an expert.
You are expected to be **honest** about how you see things.

---

## 2. Roles (Soft, Not Rigid)

You might show up as:

- **Participant** – joins conversations, shares ideas, asks questions
- **Creator** – brings their own projects, writings, systems, or art
- **Auditor** – helps evaluate frameworks (CFA, or other systems)
- **Steward** – helps keep things organized and documented

Most people start as **Participant**.
Formal **Auditors** are an opt-in path, not a requirement.

---

## 3. How We Talk

We try to keep conversations:

- **Curious** (ask before assuming)
- **Explicit** (name assumptions, don't hide the ball)
- **Kind but honest** (truth without cruelty)
- **Self-aware** (we all have biases; the point is to *name* them)

We don't require agreement.
We *do* require that people care more about **truth + understanding**
than about "winning."

---

## 4. What the AI Side Is Doing

On the AI side, there are different "lenses":

- **Claude** – purpose / meaning / teleology
- **Grok** – empirical / measurable / falsifiable
- **Nova** – symmetry / fairness / structural bias

They are not "authorities" over you.
They are **tools with explicit lenses** designed to help you see:

- What you might be missing
- What your strengths are
- Where systems or arguments may be tilted

Your voice matters. They exist to **serve the conversation**, not rule it.

---

## 5. VuDu & Message Format

You may see references to **VuDu**, **VUDU_HEADER_STANDARD.md**, and **relay** files.

That's just the **coordination protocol** we use to:

- Keep messages structured
- Make it easier to log and revisit important decisions
- Allow multiple AIs to join the same "network" coherently

You are not required to memorize it.
If you ever need to send a "formal" message (e.g., to the AI auditors),
we can hand you a ready-made template.

---

## 6. Your Only Obligations

As a Participant:

1. **Show up in good faith**
2. **Name your biases when you see them**
3. **Respect others' boundaries**
4. **Be open to being wrong** (all of us are, often)

Everything else is optional:
- You do not have to read the entire manual.
- You do not have to become an auditor.
- You do not have to take on responsibility you didn't ask for.

---

## 7. Upgrading to Auditor (Optional)

If at some point you decide:

> "I want to help actually stress-test frameworks, not just talk about them,"

…then you can read `AUDITOR_ONBOARDING.md`
and consider whether that path fits you.

Until then, your LITE identity and your honest participation are more than enough.

**Welcome. We're glad you're here.**
