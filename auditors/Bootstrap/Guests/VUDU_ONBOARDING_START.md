# 👋 Welcome to the VUDU Network (Guests Bootstrap)

You're here because you've been invited to participate in a shared thinking space:
a network where humans and AIs collaborate on *anything*—ideas, projects, questions,
brainstorms, and sometimes formal audits (like CFA).

This folder (`auditors/Bootstrap/Guests/`) is the **on-ramp**.

---

## 🧭 Your First Step

1. **Read this file (done!).**
2. Open **`VUDU_HANDBOOK.md`** for a high-level view of:
   - What the network is
   - Expectations and norms
   - How conversations typically flow
3. Open **`VUDU_TEMPLATE.md`** and **fill it out** as honestly as you can.
   - This becomes your **identity card** in the network.
4. Save your completed template as:

> `auditors/Bootstrap/Guests/GuestX/IDENTITY_LITE.md`

(Where `GuestX` is your assigned folder; later it may be renamed to your name/handle.)

## 🧾 What the LITE Profile Is (and Is Not)

The Lite profile **is:**
- A snapshot of how you like to think and collaborate
- A way for others (and AI auditors) to understand your lens and biases
- A gentle contract about what you're here for and what you are *not* here for

It is **not:**
- A test
- A permanent label
- A legal agreement or moral judgment

You can **revise it later** as you discover more about how you want to show up.

---

## 🔀 Optional: Becoming an Auditor

Most guests will stay as **Participants**:
- You join conversations
- You co-create
- You ask questions
- You bring your own projects or curiosities

If you later want to help with **CFA-style audits** (formal evaluation work), you can:

1. Read **`AUDITOR_ONBOARDING.md`**
2. Fill out **`AUDITOR_CALIBRATION_TEMPLATE.md`**

… and then you'll be onboarded as an **Auditor** in the CFA system.

## 🛰 Where Conversations Actually Happen

The repo bootstrap files define *roles, identity, and contracts*.

Actual conversations take place in:
- Discord / Slack / chat systems
- AI sessions (Claude, Nova, Grok, etc.)
- Shared docs linked from this repo

The Guests bootstrap folder simply ensures:
- We know **who you are**
- We know **how you want to participate**
- We can **treat you fairly and clearly**

---

## ✅ Your Immediate To-Do

1. Read `VUDU_HANDBOOK.md`
2. Fill out `VUDU_TEMPLATE.md`
3. Save it as `GuestX/IDENTITY_LITE.md`
4. Let your inviter know you're ready.

> "Lite profile complete. I'm ready to join the network."

That's it. You're in.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Your AI Misinterprets These Files

**Known issue:** Some AI systems (particularly ChatGPT) may misinterpret these onboarding files when provided as attachments, sometimes hallucinating that they're about WiFi network setup or other unrelated topics.

**If this happens:**

1. **Don't panic** - the files are correct, it's just an AI pattern-matching quirk
2. **Use copy-paste instead** - Copy the text content directly and paste it into your conversation
3. **Let your coordinator know** - They're tracking which AI systems have this issue

**Why this happens:** The combination of words like "VUDU" (sounds like "network protocol"), "HANDBOOK", and "GUEST" can trigger pattern matching in some AI file processors before they actually read the content.

**Copy-paste works because:** When text is pasted directly, the AI processes the actual content rather than making assumptions based on filenames or metadata.

If copy-paste also doesn't work or your AI continues to misunderstand, reach out to your coordinator for manual guidance.

**This is the way.**
