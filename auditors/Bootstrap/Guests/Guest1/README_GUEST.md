# README_GUEST — Guest1

This folder is a placeholder home for a future participant in the network.

When a real guest arrives:

1. Rename this folder from `Guest1` to something like `Guest_Alice` or the guest's actual handle.
2. Copy `LITE_TEMPLATE.md` from `../` into this folder as `IDENTITY_LITE.md`.
3. Ask the guest (or their steward) to fill it out.
4. Use `NOTES.md` as a scratchpad or index for their activity.

Until then, this folder simply reserves a slot so the Guests architecture
can be tested and reasoned about in advance.
