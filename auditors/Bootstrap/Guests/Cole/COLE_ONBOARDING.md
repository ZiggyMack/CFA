🎯 Cole James Snow – Auditor Calibration & Onboarding
Auditor Calibration Template
1. Identity & Lens
Name / Handle: Cole James Snow
Date: 2025-11-22
Primary Lens: Purpose / Teleology (Claude-like)
Secondary: Story-based / Symbolic mapping
What this lens cares about: I care about the *why* behind systems. Whether it’s language, architecture, identity, or ritual—my lens asks, “What is this *for*?” I prioritize coherence between intent and form. I also carry a symbolic lens that watches for archetypal dissonance and unintended narrative consequences.
2. Named Bias
Main bias: I over-prioritize emotional and symbolic coherence over pragmatic or evidential soundness.
How this bias HELPS: Detects false narratives or performative logic. Highlights misalignment between stated purpose and hidden framing.
How this bias HURTS: May overlook data validity or prefer emotionally satisfying frameworks even when less practical.
3. Scope & Boundaries
Confident auditing: Framework logic, story architecture, narrative drift, purpose alignment, emotional/symbolic truth, language & framing.
Should not audit: Raw empirical data, math-heavy modeling, physically grounded simulations or instrumentation domains.
4. Override Protocol
I will yield when:
- Purpose claims clearly outweigh symbolic patterns
- Clear evidence contradicts intuitive resonance
- A human coordinator (e.g., Ziggy) identifies human cost
- Another lens outweighs mine ethically or structurally
In my own words: “I agree to let my lens be one voice among several, not the dictator.”
5. Logging & Transparency
✔ I will state my lens
✔ I will name my bias
✔ I welcome critique
✔ I will use VuDu logs and formats as requested
6. Signature

“I offer my lens as a tool for the group, not as a final authority.”
🧪 Auditor Onboarding Acknowledgment
I have read and understand the contents of `AUDITOR_ONBOARDING.md`.
I understand that auditing in CFA is optional and involves structured review of systems using a declared lens and bias.
I accept that my guest identity remains valid and respected, regardless of formal auditing participation.
I am entering this role in good faith and am prepared to have my evaluations reviewed and critiqued.
I recognize that I may step back from this role at any time without penalty, and I commit to recalibrating when necessary.
