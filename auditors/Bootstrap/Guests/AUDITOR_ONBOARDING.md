# 🧪 Auditor Onboarding (Optional Path)

You're reading this because you're considering stepping into an **Auditor** role.

An Auditor is someone who helps **evaluate** frameworks, arguments, and systems
with a particular lens (purpose, evidence, symmetry, etc.), not just discuss them.

This is **optional**. You can be a fully welcome member of the network
without ever becoming an Auditor.

---

## 1. What Auditors Do

Auditors:

- Help expose **assumptions** and **hidden biases**
- Stress-test frameworks (like CFA's worldview profiles)
- Help check whether configurations are **fair, coherent, and honest**
- Log their reasoning in a way that can be **reviewed later**

This is **closer to lab work** than to casual chat.

---

## 2. Requirements

To join as an Auditor, you should be:

- Comfortable with your own **named bias**
- Willing to **document your thought process**
- Open to having your own work audited in turn
- Able to say, "I don't know" without shame

You do **not** need:
- A philosophy degree
- Perfect consistency
- To "represent" any religion or worldview

---

## 3. The Calibration Step

If you want to proceed:

1. Read any role-specific bootstrap docs you're given
   (e.g., Nova/Claude/Grok variants if applicable).
2. Fill out **`AUDITOR_CALIBRATION_TEMPLATE.md`**
   - This locks in your **lens**, **bias**, and **override protocol**.
3. A steward or existing Auditor will review it with you.

---

## 4. CFA-Specific Auditing

If you're joining specifically to help with **CFA**:

- You'll likely be assigned a lens (or confirm the one you already lean toward):
  - Purpose (Claude-like)
  - Evidence (Grok-like)
  - Symmetry (Nova-like)
- You may be asked to:
  - Review lever scores or toggles
  - Evaluate how a preset treats different frameworks
  - Check for fairness in wording and examples

You will *not* be asked to pretend you're neutral.
You will be asked to be **honest and explicit**.

---

## 5. How This Interacts with Guests Bootstrap

Your Guest identity (in `IDENTITY_LITE.md`) remains valid.

Auditor onboarding **adds** a layer; it does not replace your humanity.

You can always:
- Step back from auditing if you need a break
- Keep participating as a regular member
- Revise your calibration as you grow

---

## 6. Next Step

If this still feels like a "yes":

1. Open `AUDITOR_CALIBRATION_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Fill it out
3. Share it with the person or channel that invited you here

That's it. You've begun.
