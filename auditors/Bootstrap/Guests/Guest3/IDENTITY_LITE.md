# IDENTITY_LITE — Placeholder

This file is intentionally left as a placeholder.

When a real participant is assigned to this folder:

1. Copy the contents of `../LITE_TEMPLATE.md` into this file.
2. Have the participant fill it out fully.
3. Treat this as the canonical Lite identity profile for this guest.
