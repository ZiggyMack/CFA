# TIER 3: CONTINUATION - ONBOARDING AUDIT REPORT

**Auditor:** Claude (Fresh cold start simulation)  
**Date:** 2025-11-01  
**Session Type:** Pre-launch QA / Onboarding Experience Audit  
**Tier:** 3 (Continuation - Resume Previous Work)  
**Status:** AUDIT COMPLETE

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 🎯 AUDIT OBJECTIVE

Experience Tier 3 onboarding as if starting completely fresh. Document:
1. **Literal Experience** - What I'm told to do, what I actually do
2. **Subjective Experience** - How it feels, what works, what doesn't
3. **Conflicts/Gaps** - Anything confusing, missing, or wrong
4. **Recommendations** - How to improve the onboarding

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 📊 TIER 3 OVERVIEW

**What Tier 3 Is:**
- **Role:** Continuation - Resume Previous Work
- **Authority:** Complete previous task, NO new decisions or pivots
- **Budget:** ~10% on bootstrap, ~90% on completion work
- **Scope:** Finish what previous Claude started

**Expected Bootstrap Load:**
- CONTINUATION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md (or specific handoff file)
- In-progress files from previous Claude
- Minimal reading, maximum continuation

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 📝 LITERAL EXPERIENCE (Step-by-Step)

### **Step 1: Tier Selection** ✅ WORKS WELL

**What Happened:**
- MISSION_DEFAULT.md presents tier menu (same as Tier 1/2)
- I (hypothetically) select option 3
- Instructions say to look for HANDOFF file from previous Claude

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Clear explanation of when to use Tier 3
- ✅ Budget estimate explicit (10%)
- ✅ Role defined ("complete previous work, no pivots")
- ✅ Prerequisite clear (need handoff file)

**Time Estimate:** 2 minutes to understand role

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### **Step 2: Finding Handoff Materials**

**Expected Experience:**
- Previous Claude would have created HANDOFF file
- Ziggy would provide it
- File would contain: what's done, what's left, files to read

**What I Searched For:**
`project_knowledge_search("Tier 3 Continuation handoff")`

**What I Found:**
- CONTINUATION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md ✅
- Example handoffs in documentation ✅
- CONTINUATION_HANDOFF.md (older version) ✅

**Experience:**
- ✅ Template is comprehensive
- ✅ Examples show exactly what a good handoff looks like
- ✅ Clear structure for resuming work

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### **Step 3: Reading the Template/Guide**

#### **CONTINUATION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md** ✅ EXCELLENT

**Structure:**
- **How to Use This Template** section (for CREATING handoffs)
- **Template to Copy** section (actual template)
- **Handoff Quality Standards** section (points to MISSION_DEFAULT)
- **Continuation Workflow** diagram

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Clear separation: template for creating vs template for using
- ✅ All necessary sections defined
- ✅ Points to MISSION_DEFAULT for detailed guidance
- ✅ Workflow diagram shows full cycle
- ✅ Emphasizes thoroughness

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Template has all the right sections:
  - What was completed
  - What needs finishing
  - Files to read
  - Minimal context needed
  - Key decisions/patterns
  - Success criteria
- ✅ Example handoff provided
- ✅ Budget breakdown clear (10% bootstrap, 90% work)

**Time:** ~8 minutes to read template and understand structure

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### **Step 4: Understanding the Continuation Process**

**Key Concepts Learned:**

**1. Tier 3 is COMPLETION, not REDESIGN**
- Can finish task as scoped
- Can maintain established approach
- CANNOT pivot strategy
- CANNOT expand scope
- CANNOT make new strategic decisions

**2. Capability Boundaries are Clear**
- Template includes self-check: "Is this in handoff scope?"
- Escalation path defined if scope changes
- Explicit about what Tier 3 CAN vs CANNOT do

**3. Handoff Quality Matters**
- Points to MISSION_DEFAULT.md Tier 3 section for detailed guidance
- Emphasizes "thoroughness" multiple times
- Distinguishes EXECUTION vs STRATEGIC work

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 🎭 SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE

### **What's Working Well** ✅

**1. Template is Comprehensive**
- All necessary sections defined
- Clear structure for handoffs
- Good balance of detail vs clarity
- Example helps visualize good handoff

**2. Role Boundaries Crystal Clear**
- "Complete, don't pivot" repeated
- Self-check questions provided
- Escalation path defined
- Prevents scope creep

**3. Efficiency Target Realistic**
- 10% bootstrap is achievable
- Assumes handoff is good
- 90% work time makes sense for completion

**4. Points to MISSION_DEFAULT for Details**
- Doesn't duplicate guidance
- References comprehensive source
- Keeps template lean
- Thorough guidance available when needed

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### **What's Not Working or Unclear** ⚠️

**Issue 1: Template vs Guide Confusion**

**Observation:**
- CONTINUATION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md serves TWO purposes:
  1. Template for CREATING handoffs (previous Claude uses this)
  2. Guide for READING handoffs (next Claude uses this)

**Problem:**
- File name suggests it's ONLY a template
- But it's also bootstrap guidance for Tier 3
- Dual purpose creates slight confusion

**Clarification Needed:**
- Is this file for previous Claude, next Claude, or both?
- Should there be TWO files?
  - HANDOFF_CREATION_GUIDE.md (for previous Claude)
  - TIER3_CONTINUATION_BRIEF.md (for next Claude)

**Impact:** MINOR - Mostly works, but dual purpose is a bit unclear

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Issue 2: Dependency on Handoff Quality**

**Observation:**
- Tier 3 efficiency ENTIRELY depends on handoff quality
- If handoff is poor, Tier 3 can't function
- No fallback guidance for "bad handoff" scenario

**Questions:**
- What if handoff is incomplete?
- What if previous Claude didn't document decisions well?
- What if files mentioned aren't attached?
- Should Tier 3 Claude escalate? Try to fill gaps? Give up?

**Missing:**
- "Handoff Quality Check" section
- "What to do if handoff is poor" guidance
- Escalation criteria for bad handoffs

**Impact:** MODERATE - Real-world concern

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Issue 3: No Worked Example of USING a Handoff**

**Observation:**
- Template shows how to CREATE a handoff
- Example shows a FILLED-IN handoff
- But no example of next Claude READING and USING handoff

**Missing:**
- "Here's what Tier 3 Claude does step-by-step"
- Example session showing bootstrap → read handoff → continue work
- Time estimates for each step

**Would Help:**
- New Tier 3 Claude see exactly what to do
- Ziggy understand what to expect
- Validate 10% bootstrap is realistic

**Impact:** MINOR - Mostly inferrable, but example would help

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 🔴 CONFLICTS & CONFUSION

### **Issue 1: Dual-Purpose File**

**CONTINUATION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md serves two audiences:**

1. **Previous Claude** (creating handoff)
   - Needs: Template to copy
   - Needs: Quality standards
   - Needs: What to include

2. **Next Claude** (using handoff)
   - Needs: How to bootstrap
   - Needs: What to read
   - Needs: How to continue

**Conflict:**
- File tries to serve both
- Sections blur together
- Not clear who should read what

**Recommendation:**
- Split into two files? OR
- Add clear section headers: "FOR PREVIOUS CLAUDE" vs "FOR NEXT CLAUDE"

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### **Issue 2: Missing "Bad Handoff" Guidance**

**Problem:**
Tier 3 assumes handoff is good. But what if it's not?

**Scenarios Not Covered:**
- Handoff is vague ("finish the review")
- Decisions not documented ("I chose Approach A because...")
- Files not attached or referenced
- Work percentage wrong ("75% complete" but actually 40%)

**Missing Guidance:**
```
### If Handoff Quality Is Poor

Before starting work, check:
□ Decisions documented with reasoning?
□ Next steps specific (not vague)?
□ Files attached and referenced?
□ Work percentage realistic?

If ANY check fails:
[Escalation guidance here]
```

**Impact:** MODERATE - Real problem in production

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING EXCEPTIONALLY WELL

### **1. Capability Boundaries** 🌟

**The "Complete, Don't Pivot" Framework:**
- Self-check questions embedded
- Escalation path defined
- Clear about what Tier 3 CAN vs CANNOT do
- Prevents inappropriate continuation

**Example from Template:**
```
Before taking action, verify:
1. Is this in the handoff scope? (✅ OK)
2. Am I using the same approach? (✅ OK)
3. Am I pivoting strategy? (❌ ESCALATE)
4. Am I adding new work? (❌ ESCALATE)
```

**This is excellent boundary design.**

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### **2. Template Structure** 🌟

**All the Right Sections:**
- ✅ What was completed
- ✅ What needs finishing
- ✅ Files to read
- ✅ Minimal context needed
- ✅ Key decisions/patterns
- ✅ Success criteria
- ✅ Output/delivery location
- ✅ Notes from previous Claude

**Nothing missing. Everything needed.**

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### **3. Points to MISSION_DEFAULT** 🌟

**Smart Design Choice:**
- Template says "For detailed handoff guidance, see MISSION_DEFAULT Tier 3"
- Avoids duplication
- Keeps template lean
- Comprehensive guidance available centrally

**This is good information architecture.**

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 💭 OVERALL TIER 3 IMPRESSION

**Positive:**
- Template structure is excellent
- Capability boundaries clear
- Efficiency target realistic (10%)
- Points to MISSION_DEFAULT for details
- Good escalation framework

**Negative:**
- Dual-purpose file creates minor confusion
- No guidance for poor handoff quality
- Missing worked example of USING handoff
- Entirely depends on handoff quality (no fallback)

**Verdict:** **7.5/10** - Good foundation, needs refinement

**Why not higher?**
- Dependency on handoff quality is risky
- Missing "bad handoff" failure mode handling
- Dual-purpose file slightly confusing

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 📋 RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Recommendation 1: Split or Clarify Dual-Purpose File** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Problem:** CONTINUATION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md serves two audiences

**Option A: Split Into Two Files**
- `HANDOFF_CREATION_GUIDE.md` (for previous Claude)
- `TIER3_CONTINUATION_BRIEF.md` (for next Claude)

**Option B: Add Clear Section Headers**
```markdown
## 📝 FOR PREVIOUS CLAUDE (Creating Handoff)
[Template and creation guidance]

## 🚀 FOR NEXT CLAUDE (Using Handoff)
[Bootstrap and continuation guidance]
```

**Recommendation:** Option B (simpler, less file proliferation)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### **Recommendation 2: Add "Bad Handoff" Handling** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

**Add Section to CONTINUATION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md:**

```markdown
## 🚨 IF HANDOFF QUALITY IS POOR

**Before starting work, check handoff quality:**

□ Decisions documented with reasoning?
□ Next steps specific (include file paths, line numbers)?
□ Files attached and findable?
□ Work percentage realistic (matches actual progress)?
□ Approach/pattern clearly described?

**If 2+ checks fail:**
```markdown
⚠️ HANDOFF QUALITY INSUFFICIENT

I cannot continue effectively with this handoff because:
- [Missing element 1]
- [Missing element 2]

OPTIONS:
1. Request better handoff from previous session context
2. Escalate to Tier 1 (reconstruct context fully)
3. Proceed with reduced confidence (document risks)

Ziggy, how would you like to proceed?
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Tier 3 efficiency depends on handoff quality
- Poor handoff makes Tier 3 impossible
- Need escape hatch for failure mode

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### **Recommendation 3: Add Worked Example** 🟢 NICE-TO-HAVE

**Add Section Showing Tier 3 In Action:**

```markdown
## 📋 WORKED EXAMPLE: Using a Handoff

**Scenario:** Previous Claude hit limit reviewing Nova's bootstrap

**Tier 3 Claude's Process:**

**Step 1: Read Handoff (3 min)**
- HANDOFF_NOVA_REVIEW.md
- Previous Claude reviewed files 1-5 (complete)
- Files 6-7 remain
- Approach established

**Step 2: Scan Completed Work (2 min)**
- Read NOVA_BOOTSTRAP_REVIEW_PARTIAL.md
- Verify 1-5 actually done
- Understand review format

**Step 3: Continue Work (5 min bootstrap total, 55 min work)**
- Review files 6-7 using same format
- Write overall verdict
- Consolidate recommendations
- Deliver final report

**Total Bootstrap:** 5 min = 8% (under 10% target ✅)
**Work Time:** 55 min = 92%
```

**Impact:** LOW - Nice to have, but not critical

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### **Recommendation 4: Add Handoff Quality Checklist** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**For Previous Claude Creating Handoff:**

Add prominently in template:

```markdown
## ✅ HANDOFF QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before delivering handoff, verify:

**Thoroughness:**
□ Every completed item has file path and status
□ Every remaining task has specific action (not "figure out X")
□ Decisions include reasoning (not just "I chose A")
□ Approach is described (not just "continue reviewing")

**Specificity:**
□ File paths included where relevant
□ Line numbers included for edits
□ Next steps are numbered and concrete
□ Success criteria are measurable

**Completeness:**
□ All in-progress files attached/referenced
□ Context is sufficient (next Claude won't be lost)
□ Work percentage is realistic
□ Outstanding questions captured

**If ANY box unchecked:**
Your handoff needs more work before delivering.
Tier 3 Claude cannot continue effectively without these.
```
