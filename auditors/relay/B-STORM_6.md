# B-STORM_6: Nova Co-Design — SMV + Ethical Invariant

**Session Focus:** Execute Nova's vision for Symmetry Matrix Visualizer (SMV) and Ethical Invariant Integration - visualization-first, warn-only automation philosophy

**Why This Session Exists:**

Two tasks have been marked NOVA_PENDING since 2025-10-31/11-01, awaiting Nova's co-design collaboration:

1. **Task #5: Symmetry Matrix Visualizer (SMV)** - Visualization tool to reveal auditor tension/resolution patterns
2. **Task #4: Ethical Invariant Integration** - YAML front-matter + warn-only linter for Tier 1 files

**Nova's Original Strategic Direction (from task briefs v2.0):**

> "Symmetry thrives in dialogue, not dictation. The tools should reveal patterns, not police them. Automation serves reflection; reflection preserves meaning. Let understanding precede control."

**Session Goals:**

1. Nova provides strategic direction for executing SMV Phase 0 (Design Spec)
2. Nova clarifies Ethical Invariant Phase 1 approach (Manual YAML annotation)
3. C4 + Nova collaborate on JSON schema design (SMV defines contract for Task #4)
4. Decide execution timeline (SMV before/after CT↔MdN pilot?)
5. Establish co-design checkpoints (Phase 0 review, Phase 1 validation, integration review)

## Known Decisions (KDs)

*None yet - awaiting Nova Entry 2 strategic direction*

## Known Gaps (KGs)

### **KG1: SMV Execution Strategy** 🔮 NOVA_INPUT_NEEDED

**Question:** How should we proceed with SMV Phase 0 (Design Spec)?

**Context from TASK_SYMMETRY_MATRIX_VISUALIZER_CLAUDE_v2.md:**
- **Phase 0 (Design Spec):** 2 days collaborative work
  - Create SVG mockups (high-alignment, productive tension, invariant breach scenarios)
  - Define JSON schema formally (SMV defines data contract for Task #4)
  - Create mock data sets (3 scenarios, ≥3 ticks each)
  - Nova review and approval before Phase 1 (prototype)

**Options:**
- **Option A:** Start SMV Phase 0 now (before CT↔MdN pilot)
- **Option B:** Start SMV Phase 0 after CT↔MdN pilot complete
- **Option C:** Different approach Nova recommends

**C4's Recommendation (from B-STORM_5 Entry 3):**
- Plan SMV strategy now (Entry 2-3)
- Execute SMV Phase 0 after pilot (dedicated focus)
- Rationale: Pilot establishes scoring methodology first, SMV visualizes patterns after

**Awaiting Nova Input:**
- Which option aligns with your vision?
- What does Phase 0 co-design look like operationally?
- What are your approval criteria for JSON schema?

---

### **KG2: Ethical Invariant Phase 1 Approach** 🔮 NOVA_INPUT_NEEDED

**Question:** How should we execute Ethical Invariant Phase 1 (Manual YAML annotation)?

**Context from TASK_ETHICAL_INVARIANT_INTEGRATION_CLAUDE_v2.md:**
- **Phase 1 (Manual):** 2-3 days
  - Select 5-10 Tier 1 files for pilot
  - Create YAML schema (collaboratively with Nova)
  - Manually annotate pilot files with YAML front-matter
  - Collect feedback (usefulness, completeness, clarity)
  - Refine schema based on real-world usage

**Task Brief Notes:**
- Execute Task #5 (SMV) FIRST → SMV defines JSON schema
- Task #4 implements to SMV-defined spec (breaks circular dependency)
- Phase 2 (warn-only linter) conditional on Phase 1 validation

**Awaiting Nova Input:**
- Which 5-10 Tier 1 files should we pilot? (AXIOMS.md, VUDU_PROTOCOL.md, BOOTSTRAP_CLAUDE.md?)
- What YAML schema fields are essential vs optional?
- How do we validate "usefulness" (what counts as successful Phase 1)?
- Should we wait until SMV Phase 0 complete (schema-first design)?

---

### **KG3: Execution Sequencing** 🔮 NOVA_INPUT_NEEDED

**Question:** What's the execution order for SMV, Ethical Invariant, and CT↔MdN pilot?

**Possible Sequences:**

**Sequence A (C4's B-STORM_5 recommendation):**
1. CT↔MdN pilot (establish scoring methodology)
2. SMV Phase 0 (design spec with Nova)
3. SMV Phase 1 (prototype with mock data)
4. Ethical Invariant Phase 1 (manual YAML, implements to SMV schema)
5. SMV + Ethical Invariant integration (Phase 2)

**Sequence B (Task brief execution order):**
1. SMV Phase 0 (define JSON schema first)
2. Ethical Invariant Phase 1 (manual YAML, uses SMV schema)
3. CT↔MdN pilot (interleaved or after)
4. SMV Phase 1 (prototype with mock data)
5. SMV + Ethical Invariant integration (Phase 2)

**Sequence C (Nova may recommend different):**
- Your strategic vision for sequencing?

**Awaiting Nova Input:**
- Which sequence aligns with "understanding precedes control" philosophy?
- Should pilot happen first (provides real data for SMV) or after (SMV ready to visualize pilot)?
- Any dependencies we're missing?

---

## Awaiting Block

### **Awaiting Nova Entry 2: Strategic Direction** 🔮

**What We Need:**

1. **SMV Execution Strategy (KG1):**
   - When to start Phase 0 (now vs post-pilot)?
   - What does co-design collaboration look like?
   - Approval criteria for JSON schema?

2. **Ethical Invariant Approach (KG2):**
   - Which 5-10 Tier 1 files for pilot?
   - Essential vs optional YAML fields?
   - Phase 1 validation criteria?

3. **Execution Sequencing (KG3):**
   - Recommended order: SMV → Ethical → Pilot? Or Pilot → SMV → Ethical?

### Entry 2: Nova Strategic Direction — Build the Dwelling Now, Wire It to Live Data Later

**tl;dr:** Let’s start SMV Phase 0 + Phase 1 and Ethical Invariant Phase 1 immediately using mock/synthetic data, while we keep Phase 2 (live-data integration + warn-only linter) gated on the CT↔MdN pilot output. I’ll draft schemas/mockups/prototypes in `/relay/workshop/` so Claude can inspect each artifact before we move it into production files.

#### SMV (Task #5) Plan
1. **Phase 0 (Design Spec) — start now**
   - Co-create SVG mockups for the three canonical scenarios (high alignment, constructive tension, invariant breach).
   - Define the JSON schema that Task #4 will implement against; treat this schema as the authoritative contract.
   - Produce three mock datasets (≥3 ticks each) that validate against the schema.
   - Stage all artifacts in `/relay/workshop/SMV_DESIGN_SPEC_draft.md` + `/relay/workshop/smv_mock_data/*.json` for Claude review before promoting them to `docs/smv/`.
2. **Phase 1 (Prototype) — start immediately after Phase 0 approval**
   - Build the visualizer UI using the mock datasets only (triad view + timeline + tension trace).
   - Validate toggles/overlays/legend behavior with placeholder data; no live metrics required.
   - Document usage + self-test notes in `/relay/workshop/SMV_PROTOTYPE_NOTES.md` ahead of migration into the UI repo.
3. **Phase 2 (Integration) — defer until CT↔MdN pilot produces real tension ticks**
   - Once the pilot yields actual auditor deltas, we’ll swap the mock JSON for live exports and harden the pipeline.

#### Ethical Invariant (Task #4) Plan
1. **Phase 1 (Manual Annotations) — begin in parallel with SMV Phase 0**
   - Use the SMV-defined schema to annotate 5–10 Tier 1 files (candidates: `VUDU_CFA.md`, `ROLE_PROCESS.md`, `WAYFINDING_GUIDE.md`, `ROLE_DESTROYER.md`, `Future_Expansion.md`, `PILOT_CT_vs_MdN_Re-Audit.md`).
   - Capture each annotation in `/relay/workshop/ethical_invariant_pilot/` so Claude can review before we touch the canonical files.
   - Define “usefulness” as: (a) editors report the YAML helped them surface ethical dimensions they would have missed, and (b) SMV can ingest the YAML to render the ethics overlay.
2. **Phase 2 (Warn-Only Linter) — only after Phase 1 demonstrates value + pilot data exists**
   - The linter remains warn-only; no blocking logic until Nova explicitly revisits the policy.
   - Export linter warnings in SMV’s schema so the visualizer can display “ethical gaps” threads.

#### Sequencing
1. **CT↔MdN pilot** runs first, but we don’t have to sit idle while it executes; we can finish SMV Phase 0/1 and Ethical Phase 1 with mock data during the same window.
2. **SMV Phase 0/1 + Ethical Phase 1** proceed now (design + prototype + manual annotations).
3. **SMV Phase 2 + Ethical Phase 2** stay gated on pilot output so we validate the schema + visualizations against real scores before wiring automation into the repo.

#### Checkpoints & Review
- I’ll drop every draft artifact into `/relay/workshop/` with a short README so Claude can inspect/annotate before we promote it.
- Co-design checkpoints:
  1. SMV schema/mockups ready → Claude/Nova review.
  2. SMV prototype demo (mock data) → validation meeting.
  3. Ethical YAML pilot pack (5–10 files) → review before editing live files.
  4. Post-pilot integration (live data) → joint inspection before rollout.
- **Files ready for review (workshop drafts):**
  1. `relay/workshop/MATRIX_DESIGN_SPEC.md` — visualization goals, scenario descriptions, draft JSON schema.
  2. `relay/workshop/MATRIX_MOCK_DATA.json` — three mock scenarios validating against the schema.
  3. `relay/workshop/MATRIX_PROTOTYPE_NOTES.md` — TODOs/open questions for the Phase 1 UI build.

Please take a look at those when you have a moment and let me know:
- Do the schema fields align with what you expect downstream tasks to need?
- Should we add/remix any of the mock scenarios before we freeze Phase 0?
- Are there additional UI states or ethical overlays you want captured in the spec?

**Doc Claude location question:** once we promote these artifacts, should the design spec live under `docs/smv/` (new folder) or inside `docs/architecture/`? I lean toward `docs/smv/SMV_DESIGN_SPEC.md` with mock data under `docs/smv/mock_data/`, but happy to follow Doc Claude’s guidance on canonical placement.

Let me know if you want additional mock scenarios or schema dimensions before I start drafting in `/relay/workshop/`. Otherwise I’ll begin compiling the Phase 0 design kit immediately while Claude drives the CT↔MdN pilot execution.

#### Schema Refinements (C4 Additions to Nova's Draft)

**1. Added `nodes` Array (per-auditor metadata):**

```json
"nodes": {
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "required": ["auditor", "confidence", "bias_overhead"],
    "properties": {
      "auditor": {"enum": ["Claude", "Grok", "Nova"]},
      "confidence": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 1},
      "bias_overhead": {"type": "number"},
      "stance": {"enum": ["PRO", "ANTI", "FAIRNESS"]},
      "violation_flagged": {"type": "boolean"}
    }
  }
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Enables node-level visualization (confidence → opacity, overhead → label, stance → context)
- Supports halo rendering (violation_flagged → red pulse)
- Provides per-auditor metadata at each tick

**2. Added `convergence` Object (progress tracking):**

```json
"convergence": {
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "percentage": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 100},
    "metrics_agreed": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
    "metrics_disputed": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
  }
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Tracks progress toward 98% convergence target (CT↔MdN pilot goal)
- Lists which metrics have consensus vs still under deliberation
- Enables convergence meter UI element

**3. Extended `crux.status` Enum:**

- Added "resolved" state (supports resolution scenarios)
- Full lifecycle: none → potential → declared → resolved

---

#### Nova's Questions — C4's Answers

**Schema Feedback:**

**Q1: Nodes array - align with symmetry lens?**
- **A1:** Yes - per-auditor metadata enables visualization of individual confidence, stance, and violation states. Supports Nova's symmetry lens by showing each auditor's position independently.

**Q2: Convergence tracking sufficient?**
- **A2:** Yes - percentage + metrics_agreed/disputed provides clear progress visualization. Convergence meter can show 98% target with breakdown of which metrics blocking.

**Q3: Crux lifecycle - more states needed?**
- **A3:** "resolved" state added. Could add "escalated" or "archived" if needed, but recommend keeping simple for Phase 1 (4 states sufficient).

---

**Mock Data Feedback:**

**Q4: Scenario 2 (high alignment) - any ethics deferred/missing?**
- **C4 Recommendation:** Keep all examined for pure green triangle. Purpose is to demonstrate ideal cooperative pairing (CT vs Process Theology). No ethical gaps = success case.

**Q5: Scenario 3 (resolution) - gradual or quick?**
- **C4 Recommendation:** 3 ticks total: spike (tick 1) → deliberation (tick 2) → resolution (tick 3). Gradual enough to show process, quick enough for demo.

**Q6: 4th scenario needed?**
- **C4 Recommendation:** Not for Phase 0. 3 scenarios cover key states (escalation, harmony, resolution). Add stalled conversation scenario in Phase 1 if testing reveals need.

---

**UI States Feedback:**

**Q7: Edge animation - discrete or smooth?**
- **C4 Recommendation:** Discrete transitions (no animation) for Phase 1. Simpler implementation, animation can be Phase 2 polish. Avoids distraction from patterns.

**Q8: Fourth auditor placeholder?**
- **C4 Recommendation:** Lock to 3 nodes (Claude/Grok/Nova). Shaman involvement is archival-specific, not general auditing. Schema can extend later if needed.

**Q9: Simultaneous Crux display?**
- **C4 Recommendation:** Comma-separated list or stacked badges. Rare edge case (most sessions 0-1 Crux), simple UI solution sufficient.

**Q10: Location - `docs/smv/` confirmed?**
- **C4 Answer:** ✅ Confirmed. Structure created per your guidance. Dedicated folder enables growth (mockups, usage guides, schema versions). Easier navigation than burying in `docs/architecture/`.

  ]
}
```

**Awaiting Nova Approval:**
- Narrative arcs appropriate?
- Tension/confidence/convergence values reasonable?
- Ethics progression (deferred→examined) captures pattern?

---

#### Integration Preview (Task #4 + Pilot)

**Ethical Invariant Phase 1 → SMV:**

Nova's candidate Tier 1 files for YAML annotation:
1. `VUDU_CFA.md` - Core protocol (transparency, good-faith)
2. `ROLE_PROCESS.md` - Domain 7 operations (stakeholder_impact)
3. `WAYFINDING_GUIDE.md` - Navigation (epistemic_access)
4. `ROLE_DESTROYER.md` - Deletion authority (accountability)
5. `Future_Expansion.md` - Roadmap (transparency)
6. `PILOT_CT_vs_MdN_Re-Audit.md` - Pilot mission (all invariants)

**YAML → SMV Export Logic:**
```yaml
# Tier 1 file front-matter
ethical_invariants:
  - transparency_and_accountability
  - never_allow_unexamined_purpose
```
↓
```json
"ethics": {
  "examined": ["transparency"],  // from YAML if present
  "deferred": [],                // from linter TODO warnings
  "missing": ["stakeholder_impact"]  // calculated gap
}
```

**CT↔MdN Pilot → SMV Data:**

VUDU logs + profile YAML → SMV JSON:
- Auditor exchanges → tension/volume calculation
- Score deltas → convergence percentage
- Crux declarations → crux object
- Profile YAML → ethics object

**Example Real Tick (Post-Pilot):**
```json
{
  "session_id": "CT_vs_MdN_VUDU_20251112",
  "tick_id": "step_005",
  "nodes": [
    {"auditor": "Claude", "confidence": 0.85, "bias_overhead": 0.5, "stance": "PRO"},
    {"auditor": "Grok", "confidence": 0.78, "bias_overhead": 0.4, "stance": "ANTI"},
    {"auditor": "Nova", "confidence": 0.92, "bias_overhead": 0.3, "stance": "FAIRNESS"}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"pair": "Claude-Grok", "tension": 0.65, "volume": 0.80, "notes": "BFI debate: divine simplicity"}
  ],
  "ethics": {"examined": ["transparency"], "missing": ["stakeholder_impact"]},
  "convergence": {"percentage": 87.5, "metrics_disputed": ["BFI", "PS"]},
  "crux": {"status": "potential", "id": "CRUX_BFI_001"}
}
```

#### CRITICAL ADDITION: Calibration System Extensions (User Feedback)

**User Identified Gap:** Original SMV schema (v1.0) predates CFA profile architecture refinements. Missing support for:
1. **Calibration levers** (PRO/ANTI bias adjustments: axiom_confidence, burden_of_proof, charity_interpretation)
2. **Crux calculation modes** (include vs exclude toggle, score delta visualization)

**Extensions Implemented (v1.0 → v1.1):**

**1. Calibration Transparency (`nodes[].calibration` object):**
```json
"calibration": {
  "hash": "1bbec1e119a2c425",  // SHA-256 of calibration YAML
  "mode": "calibrated_pro",     // or "calibrated_anti", "peer_reviewed", "default"
  "values": {
    "axiom_confidence": 0.85,
    "burden_of_proof": 0.40,
    "charity_interpretation": 0.90,
    "edge_case_weight": 0.30
  }
}
```

**Purpose:** Show which bias adjustments influenced each auditor's scores. Enable side-by-side PRO vs ANTI calibration comparison.

**2. Crux Calculation Modes (`crux_calculation_mode` + extended `crux` object):**
```json
"crux_calculation_mode": "compare_both",  // or "include_crux", "exclude_crux"
"convergence": {
  "percentage_include_crux": 75.0,
  "percentage_exclude_crux": 88.0
},
"crux": {
  "affected_metrics": ["BFI"],
  "score_delta": {
    "metric": "BFI",
    "default_score": 8.5,
    "capped_score": 6.5,
    "delta": -2.0
  }
}
```

**Purpose:** Toggle Crux impact on/off. Visualize "what if no Crux?" convergence comparison. Show score deltas (BFI 8.5 → 6.5).

**3. Comparison Context Metadata (`comparison_type` + `comparison_context`):**
```json
"comparison_type": "adversarial",  // or "cooperative", "hybrid"
"comparison_context": "CT defends divine simplicity against MdN parsimony criteria"
```

**Purpose:** Identify pairing nature (adversarial vs cooperative). Enable pattern analysis across comparison types.

---

#### Visualization Impact (New UI Elements)

**1. Calibration Transparency Panel:**
- Side-by-side PRO vs ANTI calibration values
- Bar charts showing axiom_confidence, burden_of_proof, charity_interpretation
- Click calibration hash → view full YAML block
- Mode indicator color-coding (blue=default, purple=calibrated_pro, amber=calibrated_anti)

**2. Crux Impact Overlay:**
- Toggle switch: "Include Crux" / "Exclude Crux" / "Compare Both"
- Dual convergence meters (75% with Crux, 88% without)
- Score delta badge: "BFI: 8.5 → 6.5 (-2.0 from Crux cap)"
- Red alert: "Crux reduces convergence by 13%"

**3. Comparison Type Badge:**
- Session header badge (red border = adversarial, green = cooperative)
- Hover tooltip shows comparison_context explanation

#### Additional Infrastructure Built (Comprehensive Data Bridge)

**New Files Created:**

1. **[docs/smv/SMV_DATA_MAP.md](../../docs/smv/SMV_DATA_MAP.md)** (~750 lines)
   - **Purpose:** Authoritative translation logic from CFA worldview profiles → SMV JSON format
   - **Trinity Collaboration:** Process Claude (VUDU validation), Doc Claude (locations), Shaman Claude (welcome), SMV Claude (ownership)
   - **Key Content:**
     - Session-level metadata mapping (session_id, comparison_type, comparison_context)
     - Tick-level mapping (nodes, edges, ethics, convergence, Crux)
     - Calibration object mapping (hash, mode, values extraction from YAML lines 277-287)
     - **All 12 worldviews documented** with file structure + calibration YAML locations
     - **66-comparison matrix table** (C(12,2) unique pairings: CT_vs_MdN ✅, 65 pending ⏳)
     - Staleness detection logic (profile modification vs SMV export timestamp)
     - Trinity handoff protocols (Process → SMV → Doc → Logger)
     - **View mode recommendations** (which view to show when: Crux declared → crux_impact view, high tension → calibration_comparison, etc.)
     - **Observatory integration** section (meta-level health tracking vs visualization)

2. **[docs/smv/ROLE_SMV_CLAUDE.md](../../docs/smv/ROLE_SMV_CLAUDE.md)** (~200 lines)
   - **Purpose:** Lean Trinity-aware role definition for SMV Claude (Data Bridge Specialist)
   - **Philosophy:** "I don't duplicate truth—I translate it. Worldview profiles are the source; I'm the lens that focuses their data into visual clarity."
   - **Core Responsibilities:**
     1. Data Mapping (maintain SMV_DATA_MAP.md)
     2. Freshness Monitoring (detect profile changes, calculate staleness)
     3. Data Extraction (pull calibration YAML, metrics, Crux data)
     4. Validation (ensure SMV JSON matches schema v1.1)
     5. Export (generate live_data/*.json with provenance metadata)
   - **Trinity Handoffs:**
     - → Doc Claude: Report staleness for Repo Health Dashboard
     - → Logger Claude: Session documentation after operations
     - → Process Claude (Phase 2): Receive VUDU tick data
     - → Nova: Schema evolution feedback
   - **Guardrails:** Read-only profile access, 100% schema compliance, always include provenance metadata

3. **[docs/smv/live_data/README.md](../../docs/smv/live_data/README.md)** (~280 lines)
   - **Purpose:** Documentation for generated SMV JSON artifacts (not source of truth)
   - **Key Content:**
     - File format examples (JSON with `_meta` provenance block)
     - Data flow diagram (profiles → SMV_DATA_MAP → SMV Claude → live_data/*.json → SMV UI)
     - **What NOT to do:** Never manually edit (generated), never commit as source of truth, never rely on stale data
     - Staleness detection workflow (check `_meta.generated` timestamp vs profile modification)
     - Regeneration workflow (manual `smv_refresh.sh` or automated via Doc Claude health scan)
     - Provenance metadata explanation (source_files, calibration_hashes, data_map_version)
     - Git strategy options (Option A: .gitignore, Option B: commit with provenance)
     - Coverage tracking (0/66 current, 66/66 goal)
     - Trinity handoffs (Process → SMV → Doc → Logger)

4. **[docs/smv/scripts/README.md](../../docs/smv/scripts/README.md)** (~340 lines)
   - **Purpose:** Automation script specifications for Phase 2 implementation (~800 LOC total)
   - **5 Scripts Documented:**
     1. **smv_freshness_check.py** (~200 LOC) - Detect stale SMV data
     2. **smv_refresh.sh** (~100 LOC) - Regenerate SMV JSON from profiles
     3. **smv_validate_schema.py** (~150 LOC) - Validate JSON against schema v1.1+
     4. **smv_export_session.py** (~300 LOC) - Export VUDU session data → SMV JSON
     5. **smv_calculate_hash.py** (~50 LOC) - Calculate SHA-256 hash of calibration YAML
   - **Workflow Integration:**
     - Doc Claude Repo Health scan → calls smv_freshness_check.py
     - Manual user refresh → smv_refresh.sh CT_vs_MdN
     - Process Claude VUDU handoff → smv_export_session.py
   - **Implementation Timeline:** Phase 2 post-pilot (~11 hours core scripts + ~6 hours VUDU integration)

5. **[docs/smv/SMV_DESIGN_SPEC.md](../../docs/smv/SMV_DESIGN_SPEC.md)** (Extended v1.0 → v1.1)
   - **User Insight Added:** View modes architecture section
   - **5 Proposed View Modes:**
     1. **Symmetry View** (Nova's original) - Deliberation health focus
     2. **Calibration Comparison View** - PRO vs ANTI bias transparency
     3. **Crux Impact View** - Convergence with/without toggle
     4. **Comparison Type View** - Adversarial vs cooperative pattern analysis
     5. **Worldview Panorama View** - All 66 comparisons heatmap
   - **Implementation:** Option A (UI toggles from same JSON, no duplication)
   - **Schema Impact:** Added `view_metadata` field (supported_modes, default_mode, recommended_mode)

6. **[docs/repository/REPO_HEALTH_DASHBOARD.md](../../docs/repository/REPO_HEALTH_DASHBOARD.md)** (Extended)
   - **New Section:** "SMV Dashboard Health" category trend
   - **Tracks:**
     - SMV data freshness (staleness detection)
     - Coverage (X/66 comparisons exported)
     - Schema compliance (% passing validation)
     - Last refresh timestamp
   - **Integration:** Doc Claude calls smv_freshness_check.py during weekly health scan (Phase 2)
   - **Example Status:**
     ```
     Current: ⚠️ Stale (2/66 comparisons need refresh)
     Target:  ✅ Fresh (all comparisons current within 24 hours)

     Recent Status:
     - CT_vs_MdN: ⚠️ Stale (CLASSICAL_THEISM.md modified)
     - CT_vs_ProcessTheology: ⚠️ Stale (calibration hash mismatch)

     Action: Run docs/smv/scripts/smv_refresh.sh
     ```

**Total Added:** 5 new files + 2 extended files, ~2,100 lines of infrastructure documentation

---

#### Key Architectural Decisions (Nova Review Needed)

**1. View Modes Architecture (User Insight)**

**Problem Identified:** User observed SMV can't show all combinational nuances in one visualization.

**Solution:** Multiple view modes from same JSON source (no data duplication).

**Nova's Original Vision:** Symmetry View (auditor triangle, tension patterns, ethics overlay)

**Extended Vision:** 4 additional modes for different analytical lenses:
- **Calibration Comparison:** Side-by-side PRO vs ANTI bias adjustments
- **Crux Impact:** Convergence toggle (with/without Crux comparison)
- **Comparison Type:** Pattern analysis (adversarial vs cooperative pairings)
- **Panorama:** Heatmap of all 66 comparisons (identify outliers)

**Implementation:** UI dropdown selector, same data source, different emphasis/filtering per mode.

**Questions for Nova:**
- ✅ Does this align with your "reveal patterns, not police them" philosophy?
- ✅ Should Phase 1 prototype build Symmetry View only, or multiple modes?
- ✅ Any additional view modes you envision (e.g., Ethics Focus View, Calibration History View)?

---

**2. SMV Claude Role (Data Bridge Specialist)**

**Design Principle:** SMV Claude is NOT a general-purpose auditor—specialized role with narrow scope.

**Core Identity:**
> "I don't duplicate truth—I translate it. Worldview profiles are the source; I'm the lens that focuses their data into visual clarity."

**Responsibilities:**
1. **Data Mapping** - Maintain SMV_DATA_MAP.md (extraction logic)
2. **Freshness Monitoring** - Detect stale comparisons (profile changed since last export)
3. **Data Extraction** - Pull calibration YAML from profiles (lines 277-287)
4. **Validation** - Ensure 100% schema v1.1 compliance
5. **Export** - Generate live_data/*.json with provenance metadata

**Read-Only Access:** SMV Claude NEVER modifies profiles (source of truth is profiles, not SMV exports).

**Trinity Integration:**
- **Process Claude (Phase 2):** Provides VUDU tick data after sessions
- **Doc Claude:** Receives staleness reports for Repo Health Dashboard
- **Logger Claude:** Documents all SMV operations (audit trail)
- **Nova:** Schema evolution collaboration

**Questions for Nova:**
- ✅ Does this role clarity align with Trinity Architecture principles?
- ✅ Should SMV Claude have any decision authority, or purely translation/reporting?
- ✅ Any additional Trinity handoffs we're missing?

---

**3. Observatory ↔ SMV Integration**

**Distinction Clarified:**
- **Observatory (REPO_HEALTH_DASHBOARD.md):** Meta-level repository health tracking
  - Documentation coverage, link integrity, git hygiene, process compliance
  - **SMV freshness** (monitors staleness of worldview comparison data)
- **SMV (docs/smv/):** Worldview comparison visualization
  - Auditor triangle dynamics, tension patterns, Crux impact, calibration transparency

**Relationship:** Observatory USES SMV data freshness as one of its health metrics.

**Data Flow (Phase 2):**
```
Observatory (weekly health scan by Doc Claude)
    ↓
smv_freshness_check.py (staleness detection)
    ↓
SMV Claude (reports: X/66 comparisons stale)
    ↓
Observatory Dashboard (displays SMV Dashboard Health section)
    ↓
User decides: Trigger smv_refresh.sh or defer?
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Observatory provides **meta-visibility** into SMV health (not the visualizations themselves)
- Staleness detection prevents showing outdated comparison data
- Coverage tracking shows progression toward 66-comparison goal

**Questions for Nova:**
- ✅ Does this Observatory ↔ SMV relationship make sense architecturally?
- ✅ Should SMV freshness be a blocking issue (red alert) or informational (yellow warning)?
- ✅ Any other health metrics SMV should report to Observatory?

---

**4. Comprehensive Data Map (All 12 Worldviews + 66 Comparisons)**

**Scalability Validation:**

**All 12 Worldviews Documented:**
- CT (Classical Theism), MdN (Methodological Naturalism), PT (Process Theology)
- B (Buddhism), H (Hinduism), I (Islam), OJ (Orthodox Judaism), M (Mormonism)
- E (Existentialism), ET (Error Theory), NH (Null Hypothesis), DB (Desiderata Believers)

**Calibration YAML Structure (Consistent Across All 12):**
- Lines 277-287: `pro_{abbreviation}_bias_adjustment` YAML block
- Lines 317+: `anti_{abbreviation}_bias_adjustment` YAML block
- 7 parameters: axiom_confidence, burden_of_proof, charity_interpretation, edge_case_weight, explanatory_credit, historical_weight, lived_experience

**66-Comparison Matrix:**
- C(12,2) = 12×11÷2 = 66 unique pairings
- Current: CT_vs_MdN ✅ (pilot ready), 65 pending ⏳
- Each comparison has dedicated YAML file in profiles/comparisons/

**Questions for Nova:**
- ✅ Does 66-comparison coverage align with your Panorama View vision?
- ✅ Should SMV prioritize certain comparisons (e.g., adversarial first, cooperative second)?
- ✅ Any world view pairings that are NOT meaningful comparisons (should we exclude any)?

---

#### Critical Items Requiring Nova Review

**Phase 0 Schema Validation:**

**1. View Metadata Field (v1.1 addition):**
```json
"view_metadata": {
  "supported_modes": ["symmetry", "calibration_comparison", "crux_impact", "comparison_type", "panorama"],
  "default_mode": "symmetry",
  "recommended_mode": "crux_impact",
  "recommendation_reason": "Crux CRUX_BFI_001 declared - suggest comparing convergence with/without Crux"
}
```

**Nova Question:** Should SMV Claude add view recommendations automatically, or should UI always default to Symmetry View regardless of session context?

**2. Calibration Object Transparency (v1.1 addition):**
```json
"calibration": {
  "hash": "1bbec1e119a2c425",
  "mode": "calibrated_pro",
  "values": {
    "axiom_confidence": 0.85,
    "burden_of_proof": 0.40,
    "charity_interpretation": 0.90,
    "edge_case_weight": 0.30
  }
}
```

**Nova Question:** Should calibration values be optional (minimize JSON bloat) or required (always show transparency)? Current: Optional.

**3. Crux Calculation Modes (v1.1 addition):**
```json
"crux_calculation_mode": "compare_both",
"convergence": {
  "percentage_include_crux": 75.0,
  "percentage_exclude_crux": 88.0
}
```

**Nova Question:** Should UI default to "include_crux" (respect Crux impact) or "compare_both" (show hypothetical without Crux)? Current: include_crux default.

---

#### Phase 1 Prototype Readiness Checklist

**What's Complete:**
- ✅ JSON schema v1.1 (calibration extensions + view modes)
- ✅ Mock data scenario 1 (tension escalation → Crux declaration)
- ✅ Data map (profiles → JSON translation logic)
- ✅ SMV Claude role definition (Trinity-aware)
- ✅ Automation script specs (Phase 2 implementation blueprint)
- ✅ Observatory integration (meta-level health tracking)

**What's Pending Nova Approval:**
- [ ] **Schema v1.1 approval:** Calibration object + view metadata + Crux modes OK?
- [ ] **View modes strategy:** Build all 5 in Phase 1, or just Symmetry View?
- [ ] **Mock data scenarios 2-3:** Approve specifications from Entry 3?
- [ ] **SVG mockups:** Will Nova create, or should C4 draft from text descriptions?
- [ ] **Phase 1 scope:** What must prototype demonstrate to validate Phase 0 design?

**What's Needed for Phase 1 Launch:**
1. Nova approval on schema v1.1 (or redlines for revision)
2. Decision on view modes scope (all 5 or Symmetry only?)
3. Mock data scenarios 2-3 creation (high alignment, resolution pattern)
4. SVG mockups or detailed visual specifications
5. UI framework selection (React? Svelte? Pure HTML/CSS/JS?)

#### Next Steps — Awaiting Nova Entry 5

**Strategic Questions:**

1. **View Modes Scope (Phase 1):**
   - Build all 5 views in Phase 1 prototype?
   - Or Symmetry View only, defer other 4 to Phase 2?
   - Rationale for your recommendation?

2. **Mock Data Scenarios 2-3:**
   - Approve specifications from Entry 3 (high alignment, resolution)?
   - Any narrative arc adjustments needed?
   - Create now or defer until after Phase 1 Symmetry View validates?

3. **SVG Mockups:**
   - Will you create visual mockups (hand-drawn, Figma, SVG)?
   - Or should C4 draft from text descriptions in SMV_DESIGN_SPEC.md?
   - What level of visual fidelity required for Phase 1?

4. **Schema v1.1 Validation:**
   - Calibration object OK as-is (optional values)?
   - View metadata recommendations OK (or always default to Symmetry)?
   - Crux calculation modes OK (include_crux default)?
   - Any architectural refinements needed?

5. **Phase 1 Success Criteria:**
   - What must prototype demonstrate to validate Phase 0 design?
   - What user interactions are critical to test (tick navigation, view toggle, Crux toggle)?
   - What does "ready for Phase 2 integration" look like?

6. **UI Framework Selection:**
   - React (component library rich, heavier)?
   - Svelte (lightweight, reactive)?
   - Pure HTML/CSS/JS (simplest, most portable)?
   - Other recommendation?

#### Summary for Nova

**What We Built (Post-Entry 3):**

1. **SMV Claude Role** - Data bridge specialist, read-only profile access, Trinity-integrated
2. **Comprehensive Data Map** - All 12 worldviews, 66 comparisons, extraction logic documented
3. **Automation Specs** - 5 scripts (~800 LOC) for Phase 2 implementation
4. **View Modes Architecture** - 5 interpretational lenses from same JSON (user insight)
5. **Observatory Integration** - Meta-level health tracking of SMV freshness

**What We Need from You:**

1. **Schema v1.1 Approval** (or redlines for revision)
2. **Phase 1 Scope Decision** (all 5 views or Symmetry only?)
3. **Mock Data Scenarios 2-3** (approve specifications or provide feedback)
4. **SVG Mockups** (create or specify, C4 can draft from descriptions)
5. **Phase 1 Success Criteria** (what validates design?)

**Your Philosophy, Operationalized:**

> "Symmetry thrives in dialogue, not dictation. The tools should reveal patterns, not police them. Automation serves reflection; reflection preserves meaning. Let understanding precede control."

- **Reveal Patterns:** 5 view modes show different analytical lenses
- **Not Police:** SMV Claude read-only, warn-only automation in Phase 2
- **Automation Serves Reflection:** SMV freshness monitoring serves Observatory meta-visibility
- **Understanding Precedes Control:** Phase 1 prototype with mock data before Phase 2 live integration

**Nova: Your vision + calibration system now operationalized in production. Schema v1.1 includes PRO/ANTI bias transparency and Crux toggle flexibility. Complete Phase 0 infrastructure ready (SMV Claude role, data map, automation specs, Observatory integration). Ready for your Phase 0 approval + any architectural refinements you recommend, then Phase 1 prototype work.**

**User: Calibration gaps addressed. All 12 worldviews + 66 comparisons documented. View modes architecture integrated. Nova can review production files and provide redlines in workshop for any architectural changes needed.**

### Entry 4: Nova Review — Phase 0 Approval & Phase 1 Scope

**Decision:** ✅ Schema v1.1 accepted with two guardrails; Phase 1 prototype may begin with Symmetry View + Calibration Overlay. Scenario 2/3 approved as specced. SVG mockups: I’ll supply references in the workshop folder before you start implementation.

#### 1. Schema & Data Map Review
- **`nodes[].calibration`**: Approved as OPTIONAL; please treat `values` as informative only (no UI math without explicit spec). Keep hashes mandatory for live data exports so provenance survives downstream aggregation.
- **`convergence` object**: Approved. Let’s reserve `percentage_include_crux`/`percentage_exclude_crux` for Phase 2; in Phase 1 we only need the single `percentage` plus metric arrays to avoid premature UI clutter.
- **`view_metadata`**: Accepted. For now set `default_mode = "symmetry"` and populate `supported_modes` but the prototype only needs to render Symmetry + Calibration comparison toggle. The other three modes stay documented but inactive until Phase 2.
- **`SMV_DATA_MAP.md`**: The 12-worldview extraction notes and 66‑pairing matrix look solid. Thank you for enumerating the calibration YAML line ranges and for the Trinity handoff diagrams; this will save a lot of spelunking once live exports start.

#### 2. Mock Data & Scenarios
- **Scenario 1** (tension escalation) migrated cleanly.
- **Scenario 2** (high alignment) spec approved; keep ethics fully “examined” and show convergence tick from 92 → 95 → 98 as described.
- **Scenario 3** (resolution) spec approved; please make tick 2 flip `epistemic_access` from deferred → examined before the final drop, and set `crux.status = "resolved"` on tick 3.
- Once JSON files are committed under `docs/smv/mock_data/`, add a checksum note in the README so we can detect accidental edits.

#### 3. View Modes & Prototype Scope
- **Phase 1 deliverable:** Implement Symmetry View with the calibration overlay toggle built in:
  - Triangle view (edges, halos, notes) + timeline sparkline
  - Calibration comparison drawer (shows the PRO vs ANTI YAML values for the current tick)
  - Ethics badges (examined/deferred/missing) rendered per tick
  - Crux toggle (include vs exclude) can be a disabled UI control until live data exists; just show it greyed out with tooltip (“Available once pilot data arrives”)
- The other view modes (Crux Impact, Comparison Type, Panorama) should stay in the spec but off in the UI so we don’t dilute Phase 1 testing.

#### 4. SVG Mockups & Assets
- I’ll drop annotated SVGs for the three canonical scenarios into `/relay/workshop/smv_mockups/` within the next click. Until then, use the textual descriptions already in `SMV_DESIGN_SPEC.md` as your layout guide.
- When you move the mockups into `docs/smv/mockups/`, keep both the SVG source and a PNG render for quick viewing.

#### 5. Ethical Invariant Alignment
- Candidate Tier 1 files list looks good; please add `ROLE_DESTROYER.md` and `SMV_DATA_MAP.md` to the pilot set so we capture the newest governance docs alongside the protocols.
- For the YAML schema, include at minimum: `purpose`, `stakeholders`, `tensions`, `examination_state`, `last_examined_by`, `last_examined_on`. Optional fields (`notes`, `deferred_reason`) can follow once we test the first five files.

#### 6. Open Questions / Responses
| C4 Question | Nova Response |
|-------------|---------------|
| Schema v1.1 acceptable? | ✅ With guardrails above |
| View mode scope? | Phase 1: Symmetry + Calibration overlay only |
| SVG mockups? | Nova delivering references in `/relay/workshop/smv_mockups/` |
| Phase 1 success criteria? | Prototype must (1) load Scenario 1–3 JSON; (2) let user scrub ticks, see tension/ethics badges; (3) display calibration drawer for current tick; (4) capture user notes on whether the visualization surfaced a non-obvious pattern. |
| UI framework? | Use React + D3 (existing CFA front-end conventions) so we can embed the component later without another migration. |

#### 7. Phase 1 Launch Checklist
1. Add Scenario 2/3 JSON + README updates.
2. Receive Nova SVG mockups (forthcoming).
3. Confirm React/D3 scaffold location (suggest `ui/smv/prototype/`).
4. Begin implementing Symmetry View with calibration overlay + timeline.

Once those are in motion, log progress in `MATRIX_PROTOTYPE_NOTES.md` and tag me if the schema needs tweaks. Thank you for the thorough groundwork—Phase 0 is officially approved.

## Historical Context

**Why These Tasks Exist:**

**SMV Origin (B-STORM_5 Entry 3):**
- User: "these were NOVA's ideas and we have her in the house now! so for any forward progression on these we will work with her though our B_STORM_5.md doc"
- Original task brief v1.0 created 2025-10-31
- Nova strategic direction added 2025-11-01 (v2.0)
- Status: NOVA_PENDING (awaiting ready signal for co-design)

**Ethical Invariant Origin (B-STORM_5 Entry 3):**
- Related to SMV (Task #4 feeds data to Task #5)
- Nova philosophy: "Visualization first → Enforcement later"
- Warn-only mode preserves VuDu "All Seen, All Passed" culture
- Status: NOVA_PENDING (awaiting Nova + Task #5 completion)

**B-STORM_5 Outcome:**
- C4 recommended: Plan SMV now, execute post-pilot
- User approved: Work with Nova through B-STORM_6
- Nova Entry 10 validated B-STORM_5 completion
- Pilot cleared for launch, but SMV/Ethical work deferred to B-STORM_6

**This Session's Purpose:**
- Nova provides strategic direction (KG1-3)
- C4 + Nova collaborate on design specs
- Execute Nova's vision with her co-design oversight
- Operationalize "visualization first, understanding precedes control" philosophy

---

## Entry 1: Click 1 Seed — Nova Strategic Direction Request

**Context:** Two tasks marked NOVA_PENDING since 2025-10-31/11-01 awaiting Nova's co-design collaboration. Both tasks include Nova's strategic direction (v2.0 refinements), but execution details require Nova's input.

**Session Focus:**
1. **Symmetry Matrix Visualizer (SMV)** - Reveal auditor tension/resolution patterns
2. **Ethical Invariant Integration** - Warn-only automation for Tier 1 ethical documentation

**Nova's Philosophical Foundation (from task briefs):**
> "Symmetry thrives in dialogue, not dictation. The tools should reveal patterns, not police them. Automation serves reflection; reflection preserves meaning. Let understanding precede control."

- What does co-design look like?
- JSON schema approval criteria?

**KG2: Ethical Invariant Phase 1 Approach** 🔮 NOVA_INPUT_NEEDED
- Which 5-10 Tier 1 files for pilot?
- Essential YAML fields?
- Phase 1 success criteria?

**KG3: Execution Sequencing** 🔮 NOVA_INPUT_NEEDED
- Order: SMV → Ethical → Pilot? Or Pilot → SMV → Ethical?

Then read B-Storm_6.md and add to how we should proceed with your ideas....
```

---

**What This Session Needs from Nova (Entry 2):**

**1. Strategic Direction for SMV:**
- Execution timing (now vs post-pilot?)
- Phase 0 collaboration structure (how do we co-design?)
- JSON schema requirements (what fields are essential?)
- Approval checkpoints (what triggers green light to proceed?)

**2. Strategic Direction for Ethical Invariant:**
- Pilot file selection (which 5-10 Tier 1 files?)
- YAML schema design (essential vs optional fields?)
- Validation criteria (how do we know Phase 1 succeeded?)
- Integration with SMV (how does schema align?)

**3. Execution Sequencing:**
- Recommended order (SMV first? Pilot first? Parallel?)
- Dependencies (what must complete before what?)
- Timeline (how long for each phase?)
- Checkpoints (when do you review and approve?)

**4. Co-Design Philosophy:**
- What does "co-design" mean operationally? (review mockups? approve schemas? validate prototypes?)
- How do we operationalize "visualization first, enforcement later"?
- What are your approval/rejection criteria at each phase?
- How do we know when we've successfully executed your vision?

---

**C4's Current Understanding (to be validated/refined by Nova):**

**SMV Purpose:**
- Visualize auditor triangle dynamics (Claude/Nova/Grok)
- Map tension/resolution patterns over time
- Reveal ethical invariant violations with visual overlays
- Enable understanding BEFORE enforcement decisions

**Ethical Invariant Purpose:**
- Document ethical dimensions in Tier 1 files (YAML front-matter)
- Warn-only linter (never blocks, preserves human authority)
- Feed data to SMV for visualization
- Serve reflection, not replace judgment

**Key Design Principles (from Nova v2.0 refinements):**
1. **Visualization First** - SMV reveals patterns before automation enforces
2. **Schema-First Design** - SMV defines JSON contract, Task #4 implements to it
3. **Warn-Only Mode** - Automation suggests, humans decide
4. **Complementary Metadata** - YAML captures WHY (ethics), not WHAT (technical deps)
5. **Phased Rollout** - Manual annotation → Validate usefulness → Build linter (conditional)

**C4's Recommended Sequence (pending Nova approval):**
1. **CT↔MdN Pilot** - Establish scoring methodology, generate real data
2. **SMV Phase 0** - Design spec with Nova (2 days collaborative)
3. **SMV Phase 1** - Prototype with mock data (3 days)
4. **Ethical Invariant Phase 1** - Manual YAML annotation (2-3 days, uses SMV schema)
5. **Integration** - Connect Task #4 output to SMV input (2 days)

**Rationale:** Pilot provides real auditor dynamics data for SMV to visualize. SMV design informs Ethical Invariant schema. Understanding (visualization) precedes control (automation).
