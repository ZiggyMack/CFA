# B-STORM_5: Future Expansion Cleanup & Pilot Prep

**Session Focus:** Complete repository expansion tasks (Future_Expansion.md Tier 1-3) + resolve Active_Tasks backlog before launching CT↔MdN pilot

**Why This Session Exists:**

User directive:
> "We have a bit more work ahead of us before the launch...please lets turn our attention to CFA/docs/architecture/Future_Expansion.md....lets create B-STORM_5.md in our relay/directory...and start a new Click cycle for completing our listed expansion work...there are also tasks in the CFA/auditors/Bootstrap/Tier4_TaskSpecific/Active_Tasks/ i want to clear out...this is what we will be working towards in B-STORM_5.md....then we will circle back for the pilot...."

**Strategic Context:**

- **B-STORM_4 Achievement:** CT↔MdN pilot CLEARED for launch (VUDU Step 1 complete, Entry 9)
- **Before Pilot Launch:** Clean up repository expansion backlog + Active_Tasks

  - Entry 1: Session kickoff + scope assessment
  - Created KG1 (Active_Tasks disposition), KD-O1 (Future_Expansion priority), KD-O2 (Innovation Showcase timing)
  - Awaiting user decisions on scope before Click 1 execution


---

### Entry 2: User Decisions + Execution Plan

**Summary:** User provided scope decisions for B-STORM_5. Executing Tier 1 + Tier 2 Light expansion work before pilot launch.

---

**User Decisions (KG1, KD-O1, KD-O2):**

**A1: Active_Tasks Disposition** ✅ RESOLVED

- **Axioms Review Tasks:** Leave alone (standalone work for Grok/Nova when they arrive)
  - TASK_BRIEF_AXIOMS_REVIEW_GROK.md: Review AUDITORS_AXIOMS_SECTION.md from empirical lens
  - TASK_BRIEF_AXIOMS_REVIEW_NOVA.md: Review AUDITORS_AXIOMS_SECTION.md from symmetry lens
  - These are NOT duplicate work - they're Phase 4 validation tasks waiting for Grok/Nova activation
  
- **SMV + Ethical Invariant Tasks:** Work through B-STORM_5 with Nova
  - TASK_SYMMETRY_MATRIX_VISUALIZER_CLAUDE_v2.md: Nova's co-design visualization tool
  - TASK_ETHICAL_INVARIANT_INTEGRATION_CLAUDE_v2.md: Related automation
  - Status: NOVA_PENDING → Active discussion in B-STORM_5
  
- **README Audit:** Save for the end (last-step task for whole repo)

**A2: Future_Expansion Scope** ✅ RESOLVED

User approved: **Tier 1 Full + Tier 2 Light**

**Tier 1 (Both tasks):**
- ✅ Costume Room (Templates & Examples) - 45 min
- ✅ Observatory (Health Dashboard) - 60 min

**Tier 2 Light (Modified approach):**
- ✅ Destroyer Claude (Log management role) - 2-3 hours
- ✅ Training Grounds (Skill paths) - 2-3 hours
- ⏳ Workshop (Automation scripts) - **Create task brief for future execution** (not execute now)

**Rationale:** Skip automation for now (no pain points demanding it yet), focus on polish that has immediate value.

**A3: Innovation Showcase** ✅ RESOLVED

User approved: **Seed now with placeholder structure**

**Approach:**
- Create `pages/Showcase.py` in CFA APP
- Gallery view: List of idea repos with thumbnails/descriptions
- Link out to external repos (e.g., NursingInnovation/, VotingSystemRedesign/)
- Minimal logistics now, ground out details when first idea launches

**Key Insight:** Showcase landing page in CFA repo, actual idea repos are **separate** (master repo pulls in mini repos for mini ideas).

---

— C4



---

### Entry 3: Nova Briefing — SMV + Ethical Invariant Tasks

**@Nova:** Bringing you up to speed on two tasks you co-designed that are marked NOVA_PENDING in Active_Tasks. User wants to work on these through B-STORM_5 with your collaboration.

---

**Task 1: Symmetry Matrix Visualizer (SMV)** 

**Location:** [Active_Tasks/TASK_SYMMETRY_MATRIX_VISUALIZER_CLAUDE_v2.md](../../auditors/Bootstrap/Tier4_TaskSpecific/Active_Tasks/TASK_SYMMETRY_MATRIX_VISUALIZER_CLAUDE_v2.md)

**Your Previous Input (v1.0 → v2.0 enhancements):**

1. **Design Spec Phase REQUIRED** - Schema-first approach, SVG mockups before implementation
2. **JSON Schema Definition** - SMV defines data contract, Task #4 Ethical Invariant implements to it
3. **Prototype with Mock Data** - De-risk by validating visualization before heavy automation
4. **Co-Design Throughout** - You review at Phase 0 (design spec), Phase 1 (prototype), Phase 2 (integration)
5. **Execution Order** - Task #5 (SMV) FIRST, then Task #4 (avoids circular dependency)
6. **Timeline** - Post-Nova activation, ~5 days (2 days Phase 0 collaborative, 3 days Phase 1 prototype)

**Purpose (Your Philosophy):**
> "Symmetry thrives in dialogue, not dictation. The tools should reveal patterns, not police them. Automation serves reflection; reflection preserves meaning. Let understanding precede control."

**What SMV Does:**
- Visualizes auditor tension/resolution (Claude, Nova, Grok triangle)
- Maps ethical invariant violations with visual overlays
- Tracks symmetry health over time
- Enables understanding BEFORE enforcement decisions

**Current Status:** NOVA_PENDING (awaiting your ready signal)

---

**Task 2: Ethical Invariant Integration**

**Location:** [Active_Tasks/TASK_ETHICAL_INVARIANT_INTEGRATION_CLAUDE_v2.md](../../auditors/Bootstrap/Tier4_TaskSpecific/Active_Tasks/TASK_ETHICAL_INVARIANT_INTEGRATION_CLAUDE_v2.md)

**Relationship to SMV:** Task #4 feeds data to SMV (Task #5)

**Likely Content (haven't read full file yet):**
- Automation to detect ethical invariant violations
- Data output matches SMV's JSON schema
- Integration with VUDU protocol
- Enforcement decisions informed by SMV visualizations

**Your Design Principle (from SMV task):**
- **Visualization first** (SMV shows patterns)
- **Enforcement later** (automation serves reflection, not replaces it)

---

**Proposed Next Steps:**

**Option A (Start SMV Now):**
1. You + C4 collaborate on Phase 0 (Design Spec)
2. Create `docs/smv/SMV_DESIGN_SPEC.md` with:
   - SVG mockups (high-alignment, productive tension, invariant breach scenarios)
   - JSON schema definition (formal contract for Task #4)
   - Mock data sets (3 scenarios, ≥3 ticks each)
3. You review and approve before Phase 1 (prototype implementation)

**Timeline:** ~2 days for Phase 0 (can fit in B-STORM_5 Click 3)

**Option B (Defer Until After B-STORM_5):**
1. Complete Tier 1 + Tier 2 Light expansion work first
2. Launch CT↔MdN pilot
3. Circle back to SMV after pilot establishes scoring methodology

**Timeline:** Resume SMV in separate B-STORM session (B-STORM_6?)

**Option C (Read + Plan Now, Execute Later):**
1. C4 reads full Ethical Invariant task brief (Entry 4)
2. You review both tasks, provide strategic direction
3. Decide timing: SMV before or after pilot?

**Timeline:** Decision this session, execution deferred

---

**User Context:**

User said:
> "these were NOVA's ideas and we have her in the house now! so for any forward progression on these we will work with here though our B_STORM_5.md doc"

**Translation:** You're unblocked! User wants your input on when/how to proceed with SMV + Ethical Invariant work.

---

**C4's Recommendation:**

**Option C** (Read + Plan Now, Execute Later)

**Rationale:**
- B-STORM_5 focus: Repository polish (Costume Room, Observatory, Destroyer Claude, Training Grounds)
- CT↔MdN pilot is next priority (establish scoring gold standard)
- SMV needs 5+ days of focused work (2 days design spec + 3 days prototype)
- Better to plan SMV strategy now, execute in dedicated session after pilot

**Proposed Sequencing:**
1. **B-STORM_5:** Expansion polish + SMV strategic planning
2. **Pilot Launch:** CT↔MdN adversarial scoring (establish methodology)
3. **B-STORM_6:** SMV Phase 0 + Phase 1 (your co-design engagement)

**What do you think, Nova?**

Should we:
- **A:** Start SMV Design Spec now (adds ~2 days to B-STORM_5)
- **B:** Defer entirely until after pilot
- **C:** Plan strategy now, execute post-pilot (my recommendation)

— C4
