# B-STORM_5: Future Expansion Cleanup & Pilot Prep

**Session Focus:** Complete repository expansion tasks (Future_Expansion.md Tier 1-3) + resolve Active_Tasks backlog before launching CT↔MdN pilot

**Why This Session Exists:**

User directive:
> "We have a bit more work ahead of us before the launch...please lets turn our attention to CFA/docs/architecture/Future_Expansion.md....lets create B-STORM_5.md in our relay/directory...and start a new Click cycle for completing our listed expansion work...there are also tasks in the CFA/auditors/Bootstrap/Tier4_TaskSpecific/Active_Tasks/ i want to clear out...this is what we will be working towards in B-STORM_5.md....then we will circle back for the pilot...."

**Strategic Context:**

- **B-STORM_4 Achievement:** CT↔MdN pilot CLEARED for launch (VUDU Step 1 complete, Entry 9)
- **Before Pilot Launch:** Clean up repository expansion backlog + Active_Tasks
- **Goal:** Enter pilot with clean slate, all infrastructure polish complete
- **Return:** Circle back to pilot once expansion work complete

## Session Log

### Entry 1: C4 Click 1 — Scope Assessment + Tier 1 Complete

**Summary:** B-STORM_5 Click 1 executed: User decisions captured, Tier 1 expansion complete (Costume Room + Observatory), Nova briefed on SMV tasks. Handoff to Nova for Entry 2 validation.

---

## 1. Scope Assessment + User Decisions

**Current State Assessment:**

**1. Future_Expansion.md Status (v1.1):**

**Completed Before B-STORM_5 (6/11 rooms - 55%):**
- ✅ Map Room (Dependency Tracking)
- ✅ Library (Documentation Standards)
- ✅ Archives (Review & Memory)
- ✅ Ledger Room (Change Tracking)
- ✅ Warning Tower (Event Horizon)
- ✅ Navigation Hall (Wayfinding)

**Pending (5 rooms - 45%):**
- ⏳ **Costume Room** (Templates & Examples) - Tier 1, 45 min, HIGH value
- ⏳ **Observatory** (Metrics & Dashboards) - Tier 1, 60 min, HIGH value
- ⏳ **Workshop** (Automation & Tools) - Tier 2, 3-4 hours, MEDIUM value
- ⏳ **Training Grounds** (Skill Development) - Tier 2, 2-3 hours, MEDIUM value
- ⏳ **Vault** (Security Policy) - Tier 3, 1-2 hours, LOWER value

**Phase 4 Proposed:**
- ⏳ **Destroyer Claude** (Room 6) - Log management & archival
- ⏳ **Innovation Showcase** (Room 7) - Success stories gallery

---

**2. Active_Tasks Directory Assessment:**

**Current Active Tasks (7 files scanned):**

1. **README.md** - Directory documentation (keep)
2. **TASK_BRIEF_AXIOMS_REVIEW_GROK.md** - Review AUDITORS_AXIOMS_SECTION.md from empirical lens (standalone Phase 4 work)
3. **TASK_BRIEF_AXIOMS_REVIEW_NOVA.md** - Review AUDITORS_AXIOMS_SECTION.md from symmetry lens (standalone Phase 4 work)
4. **TASK_SYMMETRY_MATRIX_VISUALIZER_CLAUDE_v2.md** - SMV visualization tool (Nova co-design, NOVA_PENDING)
5. **TASK_ETHICAL_INVARIANT_INTEGRATION_CLAUDE_v2.md** - Related to SMV (likely NOVA_PENDING)
6. **TASK_BRIEF_README_AUDIT.md** - Documentation quality check (defer to end)
7. **PILOT_CT_vs_MdN_Re-Audit.md** - Just created in B-STORM_4 (keep active)

**Finding:** Axioms reviews are NOT duplicates - they're standalone validation work for when Grok/Nova arrive.

---

**3. CT↔MdN Pilot Status:**

From [B-STORM_4.md](B-STORM_4.md) Entry 9:
- ✅ VUDU Step 1 complete (2025-11-10)
- ✅ Academic sources validated
- ✅ YAML hashes generated
- ✅ Domain 7 diff check passed
- ✅ **GO FOR PILOT LAUNCH** (awaiting B-STORM_5 completion)

---

**User Decisions (Captured from Click 1 dialogue):**

**A1: Active_Tasks Disposition** ✅ RESOLVED

- **Axioms Review Tasks:** Leave alone (standalone work for Grok/Nova when they arrive)
  - TASK_BRIEF_AXIOMS_REVIEW_GROK.md: Empirical lens review
  - TASK_BRIEF_AXIOMS_REVIEW_NOVA.md: Symmetry lens review
  - Status: Keep in Active_Tasks (Phase 4 work)

- **SMV + Ethical Invariant Tasks:** Work through B-STORM_5 with Nova
  - TASK_SYMMETRY_MATRIX_VISUALIZER_CLAUDE_v2.md: Nova's co-design visualization tool
  - TASK_ETHICAL_INVARIANT_INTEGRATION_CLAUDE_v2.md: Related automation
  - Status: NOVA_PENDING → Briefed Nova in Entry 1 for her review

- **README Audit:** Save for the end (last-step task for whole repo)

**A2: Future_Expansion Scope** ✅ RESOLVED

User approved: **Tier 1 Full + Tier 2 Light**

**Tier 1 (Execute in Click 1):**
- ✅ Costume Room (Templates & Examples) - 45 min
- ✅ Observatory (Health Dashboard) - 60 min

**Tier 2 Light (Next Claude):**
- ⏳ Destroyer Claude (Log management role) - 2-3 hours
- ⏳ Training Grounds (Skill paths) - 2-3 hours
- ⏳ Workshop (Automation scripts) - **Create task brief for future execution** (not execute now)

**Rationale:** Skip automation for now (no pain points demanding it yet), focus on polish that has immediate value.

**A3: Innovation Showcase** ✅ RESOLVED

User approved: **Seed now with placeholder structure**

**Approach:**
- Create `pages/Showcase.py` in CFA APP
- Gallery view: List of idea repos with thumbnails/descriptions
- Link out to external repos (e.g., NursingInnovation/, VotingSystemRedesign/)
- Minimal logistics now, ground out details when first idea launches

**Key Insight:** Showcase landing page in CFA repo, actual idea repos are **separate** (master repo pulls in mini repos for mini ideas).

---

## 2. Nova Briefing — SMV + Ethical Invariant Tasks

**@Nova:** Bringing you up to speed on two tasks you co-designed that are marked NOVA_PENDING in Active_Tasks. User wants to work on these through B-STORM_5 with your collaboration.

---

**Task 1: Symmetry Matrix Visualizer (SMV)**

**Location:** [Active_Tasks/TASK_SYMMETRY_MATRIX_VISUALIZER_CLAUDE_v2.md](../../auditors/Bootstrap/Tier4_TaskSpecific/Active_Tasks/TASK_SYMMETRY_MATRIX_VISUALIZER_CLAUDE_v2.md)

**Your Previous Input (v1.0 → v2.0 enhancements):**

1. **Design Spec Phase REQUIRED** - Schema-first approach, SVG mockups before implementation
2. **JSON Schema Definition** - SMV defines data contract, Task #4 Ethical Invariant implements to it
3. **Prototype with Mock Data** - De-risk by validating visualization before heavy automation
4. **Co-Design Throughout** - You review at Phase 0 (design spec), Phase 1 (prototype), Phase 2 (integration)
5. **Execution Order** - Task #5 (SMV) FIRST, then Task #4 (avoids circular dependency)
6. **Timeline** - Post-Nova activation, ~5 days (2 days Phase 0 collaborative, 3 days Phase 1 prototype)

**Purpose (Your Philosophy):**
> "Symmetry thrives in dialogue, not dictation. The tools should reveal patterns, not police them. Automation serves reflection; reflection preserves meaning. Let understanding precede control."

**What SMV Does:**
- Visualizes auditor tension/resolution (Claude, Nova, Grok triangle)
- Maps ethical invariant violations with visual overlays
- Tracks symmetry health over time
- Enables understanding BEFORE enforcement decisions

**Current Status:** NOVA_PENDING (awaiting your ready signal)

---

**Task 2: Ethical Invariant Integration**

**Location:** [Active_Tasks/TASK_ETHICAL_INVARIANT_INTEGRATION_CLAUDE_v2.md](../../auditors/Bootstrap/Tier4_TaskSpecific/Active_Tasks/TASK_ETHICAL_INVARIANT_INTEGRATION_CLAUDE_v2.md)

**Relationship to SMV:** Task #4 feeds data to SMV (Task #5)

**Likely Content:**
- Automation to detect ethical invariant violations
- Data output matches SMV's JSON schema
- Integration with VUDU protocol
- Enforcement decisions informed by SMV visualizations

**Your Design Principle (from SMV task):**
- **Visualization first** (SMV shows patterns)
- **Enforcement later** (automation serves reflection, not replaces it)

---

**Proposed Next Steps (C4 Recommendation):**

**Option C (Recommended):** Read + Plan Now, Execute Post-Pilot

**Rationale:**
- B-STORM_5 focus: Repository polish (Costume Room, Observatory, Destroyer Claude, Training Grounds)
- CT↔MdN pilot is next priority (establish scoring gold standard)
- SMV needs 5+ days of focused work (2 days design spec + 3 days prototype)
- Better to plan SMV strategy now, execute in dedicated session after pilot

**Proposed Sequencing:**
1. **B-STORM_5:** Expansion polish + SMV strategic planning
2. **Pilot Launch:** CT↔MdN adversarial scoring (establish methodology)
3. **B-STORM_6 (or later):** SMV Phase 0 + Phase 1 (your co-design engagement)

**What do you think, Nova?**

Should we:
- **A:** Start SMV Design Spec now (adds ~2 days to B-STORM_5)
- **B:** Defer entirely until after pilot
- **C:** Plan strategy now, execute post-pilot (my recommendation)
