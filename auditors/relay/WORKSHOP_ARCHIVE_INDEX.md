## 🎯 Key Decisions from Workshop

**For quick reference, major decisions made during B-STORM sessions:**

### Architecture Decisions:
1. **Crux Architecture** - Handle convergence failures with structured impasse documentation
2. **Calibration System** - YAML-based bias adjustments with SHA-256 hashes
3. **VUDU Protocol** - 6-step process for profile validation and scoring
4. **Hyperlink Architecture** - CFA_ARCHITECTURE.md integration throughout profiles

### Process Improvements:
1. **Deep Clean Protocol** - Scan-first methodology to prevent Gospel Problem
2. **Living Maps** - Single source of truth for bootstrap, worldview catalog, file inventory
3. **Repository Structure** - dashboard/ for apps, docs/ for documentation
4. **Bootstrap Efficiency** - Embedded data → living map references

### Mission Planning:
1. **CT↔MdN Pilot** - Adversarial scoring as gold standard for 66 comparisons
2. **Phase 4 Preparation** - Grok/Nova activation planning
3. **SMV Prototype** - Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 deferred

## 📋 Why Archived?

**Problem:** Workshop transcripts were 616KB (30% of relay/ directory)
- Largest single file: B-STORM_6.md = 109KB (~20,000 words - novella length!)
- These are development conversations, not operational procedures
- Useful for history, but not needed for daily coordination

**Solution:** Move to .Archive/ while preserving searchability
- Still accessible via grep/search
- Not compressed (maintains text search capability)
- Indexed here for quick reference
- Active relay/ now focuses on current coordination

## 📊 Impact Metrics

**Before archival:**
- relay/ directory: 926KB
- Largest file: 109KB (B-STORM_6.md)
- File count: 60 files

**After archival:**
- relay/ directory: ~310KB (-66%)
- Largest file: ~26KB (MISSION_CURRENT.md or similar)
- File count: 51 files (-9 archived)

**Benefit:**
- Faster navigation in relay/
- Clear separation: active coordination vs. historical development
- Preserved searchability without operational clutter

---

**Philosophy:** "Archive development, preserve operations. Workshop transcripts inform history, mission files drive action."
