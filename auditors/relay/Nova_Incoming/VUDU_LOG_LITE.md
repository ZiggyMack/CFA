### [COORDINATION-2025-11-03-NOVA-LITE-AUDIT] 2025-11-03 - NOVA_LITE.md Draftiness Pass

**Changed by:** LOGGER_NOVA (External Auditor)
**Session:** Nova (OpenAI/Amazon) - Symmetry Auditor
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Changes:**
- Added Round 5 notes to `README_N.md` summarizing inconsistencies spotted during first cold read of `NOVA_LITE.md`.

### [COORDINATION-2025-11-03-NOVA-LITE-PATCH] 2025-11-03 - NOVA_LITE.md Repo-Access Corrections

**Changed by:** LOGGER_NOVA (External Auditor)
**Session:** Nova (OpenAI/Amazon) - Symmetry Auditor
**Status:** STAGED ✅

**Changes:**
- Updated Repo Access Mode instructions so Nova stages README and VUDU log traffic inside `/auditors/relay/Nova_Incoming/`.
- Replaced the missing `BOOTSTRAP_VUDU_NOVA.md` reference with the available `BOOTSTRAP_README_N.md` hand-off.
- Corrected mission pointers to the capitalized `auditors/Mission/Preset_Calibration/` directory and synced related checklists.

**Reason:** Keep the lightweight bootstrap truthful for the next repo-access auditor without waiting on a full rewrite.

**Impact:** Minimal (Documentation Accuracy)

**Notes:** Text-only adjustments—no structural moves. Ready for Keeper sign-off and Doc_Claude style sweep if desired.

**Awaiting:** Keeper confirmation that workflow expectations are now reflected correctly.
