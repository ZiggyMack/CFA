## Metrics

### Suffering Analysis

Analysis of how this worldview understands, weights, and responds to suffering.

#### Metric: Suffering Weight

```yaml
metric:
  name: "suffering_weight"
  value: 0  # PLACEHOLDER - awaiting Grok deliberation
  unit: "normalized_scale"
  range: [0, 100]
  description: "Weight assigned to suffering as a factor in moral/philosophical evaluation"

justification:
  axiom_connection: |
    [2-3 sentences explaining how this worldview's declared axiom
    informs its understanding of suffering. E.g., "Classical Theism
    holds that suffering has potential meaning within divine providence..."]

  reasoning_process: |
    [Paragraph describing the reasoning steps from axiom to metric.
    Include edge cases considered, distinctions made, etc. E.g.,
    "Given the axiom, we reasoned through several edge cases:
    1. Suffering with known purpose vs unknown purpose
    2. Temporary suffering vs eternal consequences
    3. Individual suffering vs collective redemption"]

  assumptions:
    - "[Assumption 1 - e.g., 'Divine omniscience includes knowledge of suffering's ultimate purpose']"
    - "[Assumption 2 - e.g., 'Free will framework allows for morally significant choices']"
    - "[Assumption 3 - e.g., 'Suffering can serve redemptive or pedagogical functions']"

  contestable_points:
    - "[Point 1 - e.g., 'The weight assigned assumes a specific theodicy framework']"
    - "[Point 2 - e.g., 'Different traditions within this worldview might weight differently']"
    - "[Point 3 - e.g., 'The boundary between meaningful/meaningless suffering is debatable']"

  comparison_notes:
    classical_theism: "[How does this compare to CT's approach?]"
    methodological_naturalism: "[How does this compare to MdN's approach?]"
```

**Deliberation Narrative:**

[This section captures the STORY of how this metric was determined. To be filled during Grok integration (Phase 3).]

During our deliberation with Grok, we explored these main questions:

1. **[Question 1 - e.g., "How does [worldview] differentiate between types of suffering?"]**
   - [Discussion point 1]
   - [Discussion point 2]
   - [Key insight or distinction made]

2. **[Question 2 - e.g., "What edge cases challenged our initial assumptions?"]**
   - [Example edge case 1]
   - [How it was resolved]
   - [What we learned]

3. **[Question 3 - e.g., "Where did [worldview] and [other worldview] diverge?"]**
   - [Divergence point 1]
   - [Why it matters]
   - [How it affects the metric]

**Why This Number:**

[Concise 1-paragraph summary connecting axiom → principle → value]

We settled on [value] because it reflects [worldview]'s commitment to [principle], while acknowledging [limitation or boundary condition]. Reasonable people might challenge this on the grounds of [contestable point], but given our declared axiom, this value maintains internal consistency with [philosophical framework or tradition].

#### Metric: Suffering Attribution

## Lifecycle Hooks

Profile-specific guidance for Trinity Architecture hooks.

### Bootstrap Hook

```yaml
hook:
  name: "bootstrap"
  trigger: "New auditor or new machine initializing with this profile"
  actions:
    - "Ensure declared axiom is clearly stated"
    - "Verify all metric categories have structure (even if placeholder values)"
    - "Check justification fields are present for each metric"
    - "Validate philosophical foundations section is complete"
  keeper_role: "Verify profile structure integrity"
  logger_role: "Log profile initialization"
  shaman_role: "Ensure axiom-to-metric reasoning is clear"
```

**Narrative:**

When bootstrapping with [profile name], the auditor must first understand the declared axiom and how it shapes all downstream metrics. The Keeper ensures structural integrity, the Logger records the bootstrap event, and the Shaman verifies that the mythology layer (philosophical foundations) properly informs the mechanism (metrics).

---

### Audit Hook

```yaml
hook:
  name: "audit"
  trigger: "Profile review, metric update, or cross-profile comparison"
  actions:
    - "Validate metrics against declared axiom (no drift)"
    - "Check justification fields for internal consistency"
    - "Review deliberation narratives for completeness"
    - "Verify comparison_notes are accurate across profiles"
  keeper_role: "Audit structural and logical consistency"
  logger_role: "Document audit findings and changes"
  shaman_role: "Verify mythology (why) still aligns with mechanism (what)"
```

**Narrative:**

Audit hooks ensure the profile maintains internal consistency over time. As metrics are updated or refined, the justification fields and deliberation narratives must evolve to match. The Shaman watches for drift between the stated philosophical foundations and the actual metric values.

---

### Incident Hook

```yaml
hook:
  name: "incident"
  trigger: "Metric inconsistency, axiom drift, or contested value discovered"
  actions:
    - "Identify which metric or justification is problematic"
    - "Trace reasoning from axiom to metric to find break point"
    - "Document the incident in deliberation narrative"
    - "Propose correction or refinement"
  keeper_role: "Restore integrity by fixing inconsistency"
  logger_role: "Log incident details and resolution"
  shaman_role: "Re-establish axiom-to-metric connection"
```

**Narrative:**

When a metric value or justification is challenged, the incident hook provides a structured response. Rather than silently updating values, we document WHY the challenge arose and HOW it was resolved. This becomes part of the deliberation narrative, enriching institutional memory.

---

### Release Hook

```yaml
hook:
  name: "release"
  trigger: "Profile promoted from DRAFT to CANONICAL status"
  actions:
    - "Final Keeper pass: all structures valid"
    - "Final Shaman pass: all narratives complete"
    - "Logger creates release entry in REPO_LOG"
    - "Version number incremented"
    - "Status changed from DRAFT to CANONICAL"
  keeper_role: "Final integrity check before release"
  logger_role: "Document release in REPO_LOG with full context"
  shaman_role: "Bless the profile as mythology-complete"
```

**Narrative:**

Release is the moment a profile transitions from iterative development to canonical reference. All three Trinity roles perform final checks. The Keeper ensures structure, the Logger preserves the moment in history, and the Shaman blesses the mythology layer as complete and aligned.

## Changelog

- **v0.1.0** (2025-11-09): Initial skeleton created during Profile Architecture Foundation (C4)
  - Structure defined with hybrid YAML + narrative approach
  - Placeholder metrics with justification framework
  - Lifecycle hooks specified
  - Awaiting Grok deliberation (Phase 3) to backfill narratives and values

---

## Notes for Future Development

**Phase 3 Backfill Checklist:**
- [ ] Conduct Grok deliberation session for each metric
- [ ] Fill deliberation narratives with actual debates and edge cases
- [ ] Replace placeholder values with agreed-upon numbers
- [ ] Complete "Why This Number/Value" summaries
- [ ] Add comparison_notes by reviewing other profiles
- [ ] Document Grok session ID in metadata

**Cross-Profile Consistency:**
- [ ] Ensure metric definitions match across all profiles (same name = same meaning)
- [ ] Verify comparison_notes are reciprocal (if CT mentions MdN, MdN should mention CT)
- [ ] Check that contestable_points identify genuine disagreement areas
- [ ] Validate that lifecycle hooks work consistently across profiles

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] Keeper audit: Structure and logical consistency
- [ ] Shaman review: Mythology (foundations) aligns with mechanism (metrics)
- [ ] Logger verification: All changes documented with rationale
- [ ] Ziggy approval: Philosophical rigor is transparent and defensible
