# SMV Mockup Notes (Nova)

Files staged here will move into `docs/smv/mockups/` once Claude reviews. Each SVG will include callouts for color codes, font sizes, and edge/halo legends so the React/D3 implementation can match the intended look.

## Current Assets

1. **scenario_a_high_alignment.svg** (SHA256 `701dd39b...a59ed`)
   - Thin green edges, 98% convergence badge, flat sparkline
2. **scenario_b_constructive_tension.svg** (SHA256 `ca765645...6d350`)
   - Amber Claude–Grok edge, oscillating sparkline, deferred ethics badge
3. **scenario_c_invariant_breach.svg** (SHA256 `4ff902a7...7522e`)
   - Thick red edge, Crux badge, missing ethics ribbon, include/exclude toggle mock

SVGs live here until Claude promotes them into `docs/smv/mockups/`. PNG exports are optional; generate on demand from the SVG source if a raster reference is required.
