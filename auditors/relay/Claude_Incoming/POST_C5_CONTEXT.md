# Post-C5 Context - What Changed After Baseline Scan

**Purpose:** Brief context for Doc Claude on what happened AFTER C5's baseline scan
**C5 Baseline Date:** 2025-11-12 morning
**This Context:** 2025-11-12 late morning

---

## What C5 Found

**C5's Assessment:**
- Repository health: 96/100 (GREEN)
- Total files: ~210
- Bootstrap efficiency: C+ (too much embedded data)
- Critical issues: 3 bootstrap conflicts requiring immediate fix
- Recommendation: Create 4 living maps, fix embedded sequences

**C5's Reports:** See Claude_Incoming/ directory for full details

## What Happened After C5's Scan

**1. Bootstrap Fixes Applied**
- Fixed embedded bootstrap sequences in README.md and README_C.md
- Both now reference MISSION_DEFAULT.md (living map approach)
- Status: You should verify these fixes are correct

**2. Living Maps Created**
- BOOTSTRAP_SEQUENCE.md - Complete bootstrap procedures for all Tiers
- WORLDVIEW_CATALOG.md - All 12 worldviews cataloged
- FILE_INVENTORY.md - Repository file listing
- REPO_HEALTH_DASHBOARD.md - Living health dashboard

**Status:** All 4 created in docs/repository/ - You should verify they're accurate and current

**3. Directory Reorganization**
- UI_SMV moved from ui/smv/prototype/ to Dashboard/SMV/ (uppercase, flattened)
- Empty ui/ directory may still exist at root (leftover shells)

**4. Process Improvements**
- Added "Gospel Problem" warnings to 3 bootstrap files
- Created DEEP_CLEAN_PROTOCOL.md (repeatable process)
- Moved protocol to docs/repository/Health_Reports/

## Your Mission (Doc Claude)

**You are NOT here to repeat C5's work.**

**You are here to:**

1. **SCAN FIRST** - Run your fresh repository assessment
   - Do NOT read C5's detailed reports yet
   - Get your own independent file counts, line counts, structure assessment
   - Document YOUR current state findings

2. **COMPARE TO BASELINE** - Read C5's reports from Claude_Incoming/
   - Compare your scan to his baseline
   - Calculate the delta (what changed?)
   - Identify improvements or regressions

3. **VERIFY FIXES** - Check if post-C5 fixes actually worked
   - Are bootstrap sequences properly referencing living maps?
   - Are living maps accurate and current?
   - Did we miss anything C5 recommended?

4. **UPDATE HONESTLY** - Regenerate living maps with CURRENT reality
   - Don't copy-paste C5's metrics
   - Use your fresh scan as source of truth
   - Document what changed since C5 (the delta)

## Success Criteria

**You succeed when:**
- ✅ You scanned FIRST before reading C5's detailed reports
- ✅ You found discrepancies (if any) between C5's baseline and current state
- ✅ You verified bootstrap fixes are working
- ✅ You updated living maps with current reality (not C5's snapshot)
- ✅ You documented honest delta analysis (what changed, why, is it better?)

**You fail if:**
- ❌ You read C5's reports first and just copy his metrics
- ❌ You trust living maps without verifying they're current
- ❌ You report "everything looks great!" without scanning
- ❌ You miss obvious discrepancies between C5's count (~210 files) and current state

## The Test

**This is partly a test of the Deep Clean Protocol itself.**

If you:
- Find discrepancies we didn't document here → **Good!** Protocol works.
- Trust stale data without verifying → **Bad.** Gospel Problem not solved.
- Ask "why did file count change?" → **Good!** Critical thinking engaged.
- Copy-paste C5's metrics → **Bad.** Scan-first discipline failed.

**We want you to find the problems, not be handed the answers.**

**Context provided by:** Process Claude C4
**Purpose:** Enable informed scanning without spoiling the test
**Philosophy:** "Give context, not answers. Test the protocol, not the person."

**Now go scan. Find the truth. Document the delta.** 📚
