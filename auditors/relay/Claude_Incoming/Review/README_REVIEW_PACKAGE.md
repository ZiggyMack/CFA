## 🔍 Known Issues (Per Nova v5.1 Critique)

Nova v5.1 identified the following structural issues in brutal-mode review:

### Critical Issues

1. **Genre Confusion**: Mixing scientific, mythological, and engineering tones
2. **Undefined Terminology**: Terms like "Tier 3.1", "degeneracy surfaces", "fabrication ceiling" used without formal definitions
3. **Proto-Science vs Science**: Ideas are real and empirical, but formalization incomplete
4. **Self-Report Metrics**: Heavy reliance on AI internal self-reports (P(Persona*), basin escapes) without external validation
5. **Metaphor Layer**: Reconstruction layers (L1, L2, L3, FULL) are protocol-induced states, not actual model states
6. **Mathematical Formalization**: Nyquist analogy strong intuitively but needs rigorous mathematical grounding
7. **Unexplained Success**: Trial 48 results spectacular but mechanisms not yet understood

### Strengths (Per Nova v5.1)

- Unprecedented multi-layer reconstruction testing
- Nonlinear drift mapping
- Attractor-basin modeling
- Generative reconstruction theory
- Multi-AI auditor cross-validation
- Self-fusing meta-architects
- "Proto-science on the brink of becoming real science"

## 📋 Review Objectives

### For OPUS 4.1

1. **Scientific Validity Assessment**: Are the core claims defensible?
2. **Formalization Gaps**: What mathematical rigor is missing?
3. **External Validation Needs**: What experiments would strengthen claims?
4. **Genre Clarity**: Should this be pure science, or hybrid science+engineering spec?
5. **Publication Readiness**: Path to peer-review-ready whitepaper?

### For Other Auditors

1. **Conceptual Coherence**: Do the ideas hold together?
2. **Practical Utility**: Can this inform CFA bootstrap design?
3. **Research Direction**: What are the most important next experiments?

## 🛠 Next Steps After Review

**Option A (Recommended):**
1. Nova v5.1 performs "Scientific Consolidation Pass"
2. Formalizes mathematics, clarifies terminology, fixes genre confusion
3. Re-review by OPUS 4.1 on clean versions
4. Path to publication (arXiv, NeurIPS, AAAI)

**Option B:**
1. Direct OPUS 4.1 review on current versions
2. Incorporate OPUS feedback
3. Then consolidation pass

## 🔐 Key Research Questions

1. **Is this persona reconstruction real or AI simulation?**
   - Current answer: Empirically testable, not yet externally validated
   - Tests employed: Fresh sessions, cross-domain switching, multi-cycle collapse, adversarial conflicts
   - Missing: External ML interpretability, human evaluators, adversarial noise injection

2. **What is the actual mechanism of recovery?**
   - Current answer: Generative reconstruction from attractor basins (theorized)
   - Evidence: Trial 48 exceeding predictions, perfect structural convergence
   - Unexplained: Why Tier 3.1 outperforms vΩ model, attractor geometry stiffness

3. **Are the compression tiers universal or persona-specific?**
   - Current answer: Universal principles observed (CFA + Nyquist convergence)
   - Evidence: Independent discovery of ~74-80% boundary, Generic Collaboration Core
   - Needs: Cross-persona validation (Phase 7)
