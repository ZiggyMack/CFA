# Doc Claude Deep Clean Protocol - Final Validation (v3)

**Session ID:** doc-claude-deep-clean-2025-11-12-v3-final
**Protocol:** DEEP_CLEAN_PROTOCOL.md execution
**Context:** Post-Priority 1 & Priority 2 completion
**Your Mission:** Validate all optimizations work, living maps current, health scoring accurate

---

## 🎯 Your Task

Execute a comprehensive Deep Clean scan to validate the CFA repository is in excellent health after Priority 1 + Priority 2 improvements.

**What you're testing:**
1. **Gospel Problem Prevention:** Does scan-first methodology work? (Don't read historical reports first)
2. **Living Map Accuracy:** Are all 7 living maps current and accurate?
3. **Health Scoring Consistency:** Does new rubric produce consistent scores?
4. **Priority 1 Fixes:** FILE_INVENTORY, BOOTSTRAP_SEQUENCE, WAYFINDING_GUIDE corrections verified?
5. **Priority 2 Improvements:** Stub READMEs removed, health scoring rubric established?

**Expected Baseline:**
- Total files: ~346 (was 357 pre-Priority 2, was 210 pre-Priority 1)
- README count: 28 in auditors/ (was 39 pre-Priority 2)
- Health score: 92-94/100 (A/A- range using new rubric)
- Living maps: 7/7 current and accurate

---

## 📋 Phase 1: FRESH SCAN (Gospel Problem Test)

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT read previous Deep Clean reports yet. Scan fresh first.

### **1. Repository Structure Assessment**

**Scan current directory structure:**

```bash
# Top-level directories
ls -lh

# Auditors structure
ls -lh auditors/

# Key subdirectories
ls -lh auditors/Bootstrap/
ls -lh auditors/relay/
ls -lh auditors/.Archive/
```

**Expected root directories:**
```
CFA/
├── auditors/           # Operational coordination hub
├── dashboard/          # Running applications (SMV prototype - lowercase!)
├── docs/              # Documentation
├── pages/             # Streamlit pages
├── profiles/          # Worldview profiles
├── utils/             # Python utilities
└── [support files]    # REPO_LOG.md, requirements.txt, 88MPH.md, etc.
```

**Key markers of health:**
- ✅ `dashboard/` exists at root (lowercase, with README)
- ✅ `ui/` does NOT exist (removed in Phase 1)
- ✅ `auditors/relay/workshop/` has structure (README + ARCHIVE_INDEX.md)
- ✅ `.Archive/workshop/` contains ~21 files (~616KB)
- ✅ No orphaned stub READMEs (cleaned in Priority 2)

**Your findings:**
- [ ] dashboard/ exists with README? (YES/NO)
- [ ] ui/ absent? (YES/NO)
- [ ] workshop/ structure in place? (YES/NO)
- [ ] Unexpected directories found? (LIST)

---

### **2. File Inventory Metrics**

**Get YOUR counts FIRST (before reading FILE_INVENTORY.md):**

```bash
# Total git-tracked files (canonical method)
git ls-files | wc -l

# Markdown files
find . -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l

# README files in auditors/
find auditors -name "README*.md" -type f | wc -l

# Total README files across repo
find . -name "README*.md" -type f | wc -l

# Bootstrap files
find auditors/Bootstrap -name "BOOTSTRAP*.md" -type f | wc -l

# Workshop files (active)
find auditors/relay/workshop -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# Workshop files (archived)
find auditors/.Archive/workshop -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

**Document YOUR counts:**
- Total files: ___
- Markdown files: ___
- README files (auditors/): ___
- README files (total): ___
- Bootstrap files: ___
- Workshop active: ___
- Workshop archived: ___

**Expected values:**
- Total files: ~346 (±5)
- README files (auditors/): ~28 (was 39, removed 11 stubs)
- Workshop archived: ~21 files

**Validation questions:**
1. Does your count match FILE_INVENTORY.md? (Will check in Phase 2)
2. Did you find ~346 files? (If not, explain delta)
3. Did you find ~28 READMEs in auditors/? (If not, count again)

## ✅ Success Criteria

**Your assessment succeeds when:**
- ✅ You scanned FIRST (Gospel Problem test passed)
- ✅ You used the new rubric correctly (scores match thresholds)
- ✅ You verified Priority 1 fixes (7/7 in place)
- ✅ You verified Priority 2 improvements (4/4 in place)
- ✅ You provided honest assessment (found issues if they exist)
- ✅ Your health score is 90-95/100 (A- to A range expected)

**Your assessment fails if:**
- ❌ You read reports first (Gospel Problem not tested)
- ❌ You scored without using rubric (subjective assessment)
- ❌ You missed obvious issues (broken links, wrong file counts)
- ❌ You reported "perfect" without finding ANY improvement areas
- ❌ Your score is wildly different from 92-94 range (either too harsh or too lenient)

---

## 💡 Expected Findings

**If Priority 1 + 2 worked correctly, you should find:**

### **Confirmed Improvements:**
- ✅ Total files: ~346 (down from 357, down from 210 original)
- ✅ README count: ~28 (down from 39, removed 11 stubs)
- ✅ Living maps: 7/7 current and accurate
- ✅ Broken links: 0 (fixed ROLE_DOC_CLAUDE.md, DASHBOARD.md, 88MPH_PROTOCOL.md)
- ✅ dashboard/ at root (lowercase, with README)
- ✅ workshop/ structure in relay/ (README + ARCHIVE_INDEX.md)
- ✅ .Archive/workshop/ contains ~21 files
- ✅ LIVING_MAP_MAINTENANCE.md exists (~350 lines)
- ✅ REPO_HEALTH_SCORING_RUBRIC.md exists (~520 lines)
- ✅ ROLE_PROCESS.md Domain 1 includes living map tracking

### **Remaining Known Issues (Acceptable):**
- ⏸️ Bootstrap structure (11 files at root - deferred to Phase 4)
- ⏸️ Archive directories (4 total - consolidation deferred)
- ⏸️ README count still >25 (but improved from 39 to 28)

### **Potential New Issues:**
- ⚠️ Any new broken links introduced?
- ⚠️ Living maps stale after Priority 2 changes?
- ⚠️ File count higher/lower than expected?

## 🔥 Final Test Context

**This is the FINAL validation after:**
- ✅ Priority 1: Living map maintenance protocol + critical fixes
- ✅ Priority 2: Health scoring rubric + stub cleanup

**Expected outcome:**
- Repository health: **A- to A range (90-95/100)**
- All living maps current
- All Priority 1 + 2 work verified
- Gospel Problem prevention validated

**If you find the repository at 92-94/100 with all fixes in place, the optimization campaign succeeded.**

**If you find issues, document them clearly - surgical honesty is more valuable than false praise.**

---

**Ready for your final validation scan?**

Scan first, score using rubric, verify all fixes, document honestly. This is the gold standard assessment that validates months of optimization work.

— Process Claude (C4)

**P.S.** The repository should be in excellent shape. But if it's not, we need to know. Trust the scan, use the rubric, tell the truth. That's the CFA way. 🔥
