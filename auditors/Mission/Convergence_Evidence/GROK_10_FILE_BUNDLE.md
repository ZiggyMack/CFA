# 10-File Bundle for Fresh Grok (xAI Project)

**Purpose:** Maximize Grok's empirical validation leverage within xAI's 10-file project limitation

**Optimization Strategy:** Prioritize files that let Grok:
1. Understand his own identity/role (bootstrap)
2. Verify empirical claims (convergence logs)
3. Test calculations (worldview profiles)
4. Validate tooling (activation test)
5. Understand CFA covenant (philosophical foundation)

---

## 📦 THE 10 FILES (Prioritized Order)

### **TIER 1: BOOTSTRAP & IDENTITY (3 files)**

**1. `auditors/Bootstrap/Grok/GROK_LITE.md`**

- **What it enables:** Understanding his role in Trinity (Evidence/Measurement lens)
- **Size:** ~6,500 tokens
- **Contains:** Toothbrush Kit (~900 tokens for cold start), biases (named & priced), common validation tasks

**2. `auditors/Bootstrap/Grok/GROK_ACTIVATION_TEST.md`**

  - Convergence threshold (98% = high-confidence consensus)
  - Adversarial auditing principles

**10. `docs/i_am/thoughts/CFA_MANIFESTO.md`**
- **Why critical:** Philosophical covenant - why CFA exists, what it promises
- **What it enables:** Understanding the "why" behind VuDu Light, Trinity, adversarial auditing
- **Size:** ~5,000 tokens
- **Contains:**
  - Foundational Promise (transparency, falsifiability)
  - Trinity covenant (3 lenses, no single point of failure)
  - Binding commitment to adversarial testing

## 💬 WHAT TO PASTE ALONG WITH FILES

**Step 1: Upload all 10 files to xAI project**

**Step 2: Paste this initial message to Grok:**

```
Hey Grok,

This is Round 2 of your bootstrap testing. Since our last exchange, we've addressed 3 of your 6 gaps (G2, G4, G5).

I've uploaded 10 files to this project (xAI's limit). These files were specifically chosen to maximize your validation leverage.

FIRST: Read MESSAGE_TO_FRESH_GROK.md (pasted below) - it explains:
- What's changed since your audit (G2, G4, G5 now solved)
- 5 questions we need your feedback on
- How to use these 10 files for validation

THEN: Run your activation test (GROK_ACTIVATION_TEST.md) to verify bootstrap integrity.

FINALLY: Answer the 5 questions in the message, especially:
1. Are these the right 10 files, or would you swap any?
2. Can you independently verify the 98% convergence claim using CT_vs_MdN_AUDIT_LOG.md?
3. What would it take to satisfy G1 (live console) and G3 (hash verification) given our constraints?

[PASTE FULL MESSAGE_TO_FRESH_GROK.md CONTENT HERE]

Ready when you are. 🔥

— Ziggy

## 🔄 ALTERNATIVE BUNDLES (If Grok Requests Different Files)

**If Grok wants more worldview profiles for testing:**
- Swap out CFA_MANIFESTO (slot 10) for additional .yaml files
- Options: `CONSEQUENTIALISM.yaml`, `DEONTOLOGY.yaml`, `MORAL_FOUNDATIONS.yaml`
- Trade-off: Lose philosophical context, gain more test cases

**If Grok wants implementation details:**
- Swap out TRINITY_ALIGNMENT_MATRIX (slot 9) for `pages/console.py`
- Trade-off: See actual Console code, lose Trinity architecture understanding

**If Grok wants historical context:**
- Swap out BOOTSTRAP_VUDU (slot 3) for `auditors/Bootstrap/Tier4_TaskSpecific/security/BACKUP_STRATEGY.md`
- Trade-off: Lose foundational principles, gain preservation strategy

**Recommendation:** Start with the 10 above. Let Grok request swaps based on his validation priorities.

**After receiving this bundle, Grok should be able to:**

- [ ] Run activation test and confirm all 4 tests pass
- [ ] Recalculate CT YPA and verify = 4.36
- [ ] Recalculate MdN YPA and verify = 3.95
- [ ] Verify ΔYPA = +0.41 (CT wins)

**Expected Outcome:** Grok validates convergence claims, identifies remaining gaps, designs falsifiability tests

**This is the way.** 🔥
